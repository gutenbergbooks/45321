<h2><a name="chap01" id="chap01"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is only within the last few years that the importance
of folk-lore, the popular legends, tales, drolls, and
extravagances which have been handed down from
generation to generation among the labourers, peasants
and youth of a nation, has been frankly recognised. It
is now, however, generally acknowledged that this kind
of literature, which more than all other deserves the
name of popular, possesses a value beyond any
momentary amusement which the tales themselves may
afford, and it has assumed an honourable post side by
side with other and graver materials, and has obtained
a recognised use in deciding the conclusions of the historian
and ethnologist. It is fortunate that the utility
of these &lsquo;tales and old wives&rsquo; fables&rsquo; should have been
thus recognised, otherwise the dull utilitarianism of
modern educators would soon have trampled out these
fragments of the &lsquo;elder time,&rsquo; and have left to our
children no alternative than that of &lsquo;being crammed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>2]</a></span>
with geography and natural history.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The collection
of Serbian popular tales, now translated into English
and here published, is an additional contribution to our
knowledge of such literature&mdash;the most venerable
secular literature, it may be, which has come down to
our times.</p>

</div>

<p>At the wish of the lady who has selected and translated
these tales, I have undertaken to edit them. In
doing so I have, however, preserved, as far as possible,
the literality of her version, and have limited myself to
the addition of a few notes to the text. The
tales included in this volume have been selected
from two collections of Serbian folk-lore; the greater
part from the well-known &lsquo;Srpske narodne pripovijetke,&rsquo;
of Vuk Stefanovich Karadjich, published at
Vienna, in 1853, and others from the &lsquo;Bosniacke
narodne pripovijetke,&rsquo; collected by the &lsquo;Society of
Young Bosnia,&rsquo; the first part of which collection was
printed at Sissek, in Croatia, in 1870. The collection of
Vuk Stefanovich Karadjich was translated into German
by his daughter Wilhelmina, and printed at Berlin, in
1854.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> To this volume, which is dedicated to the Princess
Julia, widow of the late Prince Michael Obrenovich
III., Jacob Grimm, who suggested to Karadjich the
utility of making the original collection, has contributed
a short but interesting preface.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_2_2">[2]</a></span>
&lsquo;Volksm&auml;rchen der Serben, gesammelt und herausgegeben von
Vuk Stephanowitsch Karadschitsch.&rsquo; Berlin, 1854. <a href="#FNanchor_2_2">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>The collection of Vuk Karadjich was gathered by
him from the lips of professional story-tellers, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>3]</a></span>
old peasant women in Serbia and the Herz&eacute;govina.
One of these stories, translated in the present volume,
and here called &lsquo;The Wonderful Kiosk,&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Kiosk
in the Sky,&rsquo; was however written out and contributed
to this collection by Prince Michael, the late and
lamented ruler of Serbia, who had heard it, in childhood,
from the lips of his nurse. The Bosniac collection
was made by young theological students from that
country&mdash;members of the college at Dyakovo, in
Croatia.</p>

<p>The taste for this species of literature has, during the
last few years, led to the publication of various collections
of traditional folk-tales, legends, and sagas, from
all countries including and lying between Iceland and
the southern extremity of Africa and of Polynesia, until
a very ample body of such stories have been made
accessible even to the mere English reader. Whilst Mr.
Thorpe<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Mr. Dasent<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> have directed their attention
to Iceland and the Scandinavian kingdoms, Mr. Campbell
has rendered important service by his large
collection of West Highland stories.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Indian legends,
and folk-lore in general, has been illustrated by the
volumes of Mr. W.&nbsp;H. Wilson, Dr. Muir<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, Colonel
Jacob, Mr. Kelly<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, and Miss Frere<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; and the Cingalese
traditions by the writings of Mr. Turnour, and especially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
by the volumes of Mr. Spence Hardy.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Russian and
North Slavonic folk-lore has been made accessible and
arranged in the valuable volumes of Mr. Ralston, on
&lsquo;The Songs of the Russian People,&rsquo; and on &lsquo;Russian
Folk-Lore.&rsquo; Dr. Bleek has collected some of the myths
and popular tales of the tribes in the neighbourhood of
the Cape of Good Hope<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>; and Sir George Grey has done
the same good service in preserving specimens of the
folk-tales of the people of New Zealand.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Whilst
foreign countries have given up their stores of popular
literature to these investigations, similar industry has
been shown in collecting the traditions and folk-lore of
our own country. The songs collected in Sir Walter
Scott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Border Minstrelsy,&rsquo; illustrated as they are by
the notes which he added, are a store-house alike for the
northern counties of England and the southern counties
of Scotland. Mr. Wright and Mr. Cockayne, in their
volumes, that on the &lsquo;Literature of the Middle Ages,&rsquo;
by the former gentleman, and that of the &lsquo;Leechdoms
of Early England,&rsquo; by the latter, have brought together
the folk-lore of our forefathers; and in the pages of
Baker<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, Chambers<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, Hone<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, Henderson<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, Hunt<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>,
and others, are stored up much of the local folk-lore and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
tales which still exist amongst us, and which we have
inherited from our Aryan ancestors,&mdash;echoes of stories
first heard by them in their home in Central Asia.</p>

<p>By means of these and similar collections, we are enabled
to trace and compare the folk-tale in the various
stages of its growth, and note its modifications, according
to the religion of the people who have received it,
and the climate of the countries in which it has been
naturalised. In the pages of Professor Max M&uuml;ller, of
Mr. Baring Gould, and of Mr. Cox, we have attempts,
more or less successful, to treat these stories scientifically,
and to trace and explain the origin and motive
of the various popular tales and legends which are comprehended
under the name of folk-lore.</p>

<p>An examination of these collections leads to the conclusion
that&mdash;apart at least from the legends of history&mdash;the
number of strictly original folk-tales is but
small; and that people, settled for ages in countries
separated geographically, have yet possessed from
remote antiquity a popular literature, which must have
been the common property of the race before it
branched into nations; but that the natural accretions,
the growth of time, together with local colouring, fragments
of historical facts, the influence of popular religious
belief, and, above all, the exigencies and ingenuity
of professional story-tellers, have so modified
these primitive tales and legends, that an appearance
of originality has been imparted to current popular
tales, which, however, a larger acquaintance with folk-lore,
and a more extended investigation, are now gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
dispelling. It is at length evident that various
primitive legendary and traditionary elements have been
combined in most of these tales; and that the only
originality consists in such combination. They resemble
a piece of tesselated work made up of cubes of
coloured stone, the tints of which are really few in
number, though they admit of being arranged into a
variety of figures after the fancy of the artist.</p>

<p>In the appendix to Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Notes on the
Folk-Lore of the Northern Counties of England,&rsquo; under
the appropriate name of &lsquo;Story-radicals,&rsquo; the reader will
find a useful and suggestive classification of the elements
which enter into the composition of various
popular tales borrowed from Von Hahn&rsquo;s introduction
to his collection of Greek and Albanian folk-tales; and
although this classification is rendered imperfect by the
recent large increase of such stories, yet it suffices to
explain the manner in which fragments selected from
other popular fictions have been built up and agglutinated
together. Philological research is day by day
illustrating more clearly the original oneness of the
language of mankind; and collections of household
stories and popular legends are showing that much of
the really popular literature, especially such as lingers
in lands uninvaded by modern civilisation, and in sequestered
spots in the midst of such civilisation, was
possessed in common, before mankind was parted off
into races, and subdivided into tribes and nations; so
that they also furnish another proof of the unity of the
human race. We are still able, at least to some extent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
to trace the genealogy of many popular stories, and to
ascend to their fountain-head, or at least to such a
distance as to indicate the time when they originated,
and the land where they were first told. Thus we may
feel sure that had some of the tales in this volume been
the original fancies of Slavonic minstrels and story-tellers
they would not have been garnished with crocodiles,
alligators, elephants, and the fauna and flora of
Hindoostan, and that the germ of such stories must
therefore have existed before the Slav made his home
in Europe. Such accessories are sufficient proof that
the tales themselves could not have been indigenous to
the banks of the Danube, but must have been brought
thither by a race which had migrated from a more
southern and eastern home.</p>

<p>Whilst the original home of these stories may thus
be satisfactorily proved to have been in other lands than
that in which they are now found, the growth of the
tale, story, legend, or droll may be traced by an examination
of the stories themselves. They are, in most
instances, composite&mdash;an agglutination of fragments
such as is seen in the breccias and similar stones of
igneous origin. The desire of being credited with
originality&mdash;a common weakness of humanity&mdash;the
necessity of lengthening out a tale so as to fill up a
definite amount of time in its recitation, and the wish
to amuse by novel combinations&mdash;all tended to the
structural growth of these tales. This was effected in
part by the unexpected arrangements of old and well-known
incidents, in part by the easier and coarser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
expedient of mere repetition. Thus, a common trick
of the story-teller was to repeat all the details of the
events which happened to one of the personages in his
story, and to attribute them to each of the three, or even
the seven heroes who had started in search of adventures,
and whom he makes meet with precisely similar
fortunes. These repetitions sometimes appear and are
sometimes dispensed with, according to the exigencies
of time, or the skill of the narrator. The other expedient
of adding to the original tale incidents taken from
other stories, admits of the exercise of much ingenuity
on the part of the story-teller, and entitled him, in some
degree, to the credit of originality. The fact remains,
however, that the materials out of which such stories
are constructed are less numerous than the stories themselves;
which have for thousands of years delighted
and amused, and sometimes instructed, both old and
young alike, the peasant and the prince, the rude
Hottentot of Southern Africa, the stolid boor of Russia,
and the quick-witted and intelligent Greek.</p>

<p>It is comparatively an easy task to trace the popular
stories which are familiar to us, to the countries where
they were originally told; or, at least, to decide approximately
as to the land of their birth. Still more
easy to decompose them, and separate the original germ
from the accretions which have gathered around it in its
course. It is not so easy, however, to determine the
motive of the original story. According to one school
of writers, these popular folk-tales embody profound
mythological dogmas, and were even purposely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>9]</a></span>
constructed to convey, by means of symbolical or histrionic
teaching, the maxims of ancient religions and philosophies.
To some extent this is possibly true; apart,
however, from the fact, and the speculations which the
facts may give rise to, the truth or falsity of this is of
but little practical value. No skill which we possess
can decide with any certainty as to the mythological or
non-mythological origin of a folk-tale, or families of
such tales, and the attempts which have been made to
interpret such tales in accordance with mythology, have
ended in absurd failures.</p>

<p>Much confusion of thought, as it appears to me, exists
as to the mythological motive which is claimed for
many of these folk-tales; and men have confounded
the mythological explanation of a tale with its mythological
origin and motive. We shall, however, have
done but little in the way of clearing up this question
when we have adjusted the various incidents of a folk-tale
to the teaching of ancient mythology. The attempt
to do so resembles the labours of the neo-Platonic expounders
of declining Paganism, in their endeavours to
make it appear more reasonable by giving to the gross
and material incidents of ancient polytheism a subtle
and recondite spiritual interpretation. The question&mdash;too
frequently lost sight of&mdash;being not whether the incidents
of Pagan mythology might by any such process
be reconciled with the intellect of a philosopher, but
whether the incidents themselves originated in the
intent to present spiritual truth to the mind, and were
bodied forth in order to convey such spiritual lessons to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
the apprehension of the worshipper. There is a similar
order to be observed in the examination and interpretation
of these tales; and the most ingenious interpretation
of a folk-tale, and its adjustment to the incidents of
mythology, do not advance us one step towards determining
its motive, and clearing up the obscurities
which surround its origin. Again, the presence of
mythological incidents in a tale in no degree accounts
for its origin; nor does it assist us in proving these tales
to possess a mythological character. In popular literature&mdash;especially
in such a literature as that of which I
am speaking&mdash;the tone of the popular mind must needs
be reflected; and if mythology had, at the date of the
creation of the tale, or during its growth, any considerable
hold over the popular mind, this fact would be
indicated by the characters introduced, as well as by
the general colouring given to the tale itself; just as a
profoundly religious mind tinges the creations of the
imagination or the productions of the intellect with the
religious convictions which possess it. But tales and
scientific treatises may be profoundly Christian in their
<i>ethos</i>, without it being necessary for us to attribute to
their authors the intention of presenting, by this
means, an esoteric explanation of the articles of the
Creed.</p>

<p>Now it is to be borne in mind, that at the time when
most of the primary materials, out of which these folk-tales
are constructed, originated, polytheism had peopled
the groves and streams, the mountains and the valleys,
the hills and plains, the sky above and the deep sea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
below, and even the centre of the earth, with supernatural
beings. Every day and every fraction of life
had its tutelary; every family its special <i>lar</i>; and every
individual its <i>genius</i>, or guardian spirit. Omnipresence
was subdivided into atoms, and an atom was everywhere
present. Under such circumstances it would
hardly have been possible to construct a tale or to rearrange
the fragments of older tales without introducing
these elements of the popular belief. Without
doing so, indeed, a tale would not&mdash;could not have
become a folk-tale. This, however, in no way makes
probable the mythological signification and origin of
such tales, any more than the introduction of
guns and pistols, of gas or the telegraph, into a modern
tale, would prove it to have a military or a scientific
motive.</p>

<p>A specimen of the way in which folk-tales are interpreted
mythologically will, I think, show at once the
ingenuity of the interpreter and the baselessness of the
interpretation. The tale which I cite as a specimen of
this kind of treatment is one which, like folk-tales in
general, occurs in several forms in England, in
Southern Italy, in Germany, in the Tyrol, in Hungary,
in Iceland, Swabia, Wallachia, and Greece, and probably
in other countries. I give it in the form in which
it appears in the &lsquo;Modern Greek Household Tales,&rsquo;
edited by Von Hahn, because the Greek version of this
tale has the merit of being &lsquo;shorter than most of its
variants.&rsquo; The ingenious though fanciful explanation
will be found in the appendix to Mr. Henderson&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
&lsquo;Notes on the Folk-Lore of the Northern Counties of
England&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A man and a woman had no children; the woman
prayed that she might be granted one, even though it
were a serpent; and in due course of time she brought
forth a serpent, which left the house and took up its
abode in a hole.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The woman is a terrible shrew, and a bad woman to
boot; she brings the house to poverty, and then goes
to the serpent to ask for relief. The serpent gives his
mother a gold-dropping ass, warning her never to let
it touch water. The couple live on the gold for some
while, but at last the woman leads the ass to the water,
and it runs away and is lost. She goes once more to
her child, who gives her a pitcher, which does all she
wants; she sells this to the king, and is reduced to
poverty. The old man now goes to the serpent&rsquo;s lair
and obtains a stick, to which he says, &ldquo;Up stick, and
do your duty!&rdquo; whereupon it knocks the woman on the
head and kills her; so the man lives in happiness ever
after.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On this, the writer who undertakes to interpret this
tale observes&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That these stories rest upon a common mythological
foundation, there is strong evidence to prove. The
gold-dropping animal, the magic table or napkin, the
self-acting cudgel, appear in some of the tales of ancient
India, and their original signification is made apparent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The master, who gives the three precious gifts, is
the All Father&mdash;the Supreme Spirit. The gold and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
jewel dropping ass is the spring cloud hanging in the
sky, and shedding the bright productive Vernal
showers. The table which covers itself is the earth
becoming covered with flowers and fruit at the bidding
of the New Year. But there is a check; rain is withheld,
the process of vegetation is stayed, by some evil
influence. Then comes the Thunder cloud, out of
which leaps the bolt and rains pour down, the earth
receives them, and is covered with abundance&mdash;all that
was lost is restored.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The incident of the dropping of jewels only appears
in the Neapolitan version, given in the &lsquo;Pentamerone&rsquo;
of Giambattista Basile,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and is apparently an addition
made by him to the original story. The explanation
of the meaning of the tale, it appears to me, might as
fittingly have been taken from the region of science, or
of history, and might have been as easily interpreted
in a thousand and one other ways as in this. So that
if, originally, the folk-tale embodied a mythological
truth, which, however, may be affirmed or denied with
equal right, the fact is of no value in aiding us to determine
what the intentions of the inventor of the tale
must have been.</p>

<p>Mythological symbolism, like very much of what
passes current as ecclesiastical symbolism, is a testimony
to the ingenuity of the interpreter; it has, oftentimes,
no existence in the object interpreted. We may,
to our own satisfaction, perhaps, resolve the sternest
facts into impalpable fancies; the fact remains, and will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
remain when the fancy has faded into its original
nothingness or lingers only as a beautiful freak of
fancy. The twelve C&aelig;sars were living and historical
personages, though an ingenious apologist has reduced
them into mythological non-existences, and has traced
in them a likeness to the twelve signs of the Zodiac.
Mythological and legendary incidents, it is true, have
a tendency to fasten themselves upon real men and
women until, like parasitical plants round the trunk of
a tree, they conceal the true character of those who are
thus clothed. Sir Richard Whittington, however, was
Lord Mayor of London, though the sounds heard from
the brow of Highgate Hill&mdash;</p>

<p>Probably many of these stories possess an historical
origin, and could we recover their original form, they
might be found to record real incidents in the life of an
historical personage or of a nation. The original form,
however, can now hardly be even guessed at. Successive
generations of story-tellers have added to the
original tale, and have changed archaic incidents for
those better understood by the audience, and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
appealing the readier to their sympathies. When
transplanted from its home to a distant land the local
colouring has been changed, unintelligible customs
have been made to give place to vernacular ones, until
so little remains of the old tale that even with the help
of comparative analysis it is now impossible to recover
the form in which it was given out at the first. Even
with a written literature and with diffused information,
Shakespeare found it necessary to the stories which he
dramatized to interweave appliances made known by
modern discoveries, and, accordingly, anachronisms
abound in his plays. If this has been the case even
where the national literature was a written one, we
might be confident beforehand that we should find the
story-teller of the Southern Slavs lengthening out and
giving variety to his tale, not from the stores of arch&aelig;ology,
but from such common, every-day customs as
would appeal forcibly to his simple audience.</p>

<p>The reader who is familiar with the stories accumulated
by recent collectors, will trace, without difficulty,
in the present volume, those fragments of the primary
tales out of which story-tellers in all parts of the world
have for many generations constructed or expanded
their own tales. It is, therefore, unnecessary for me to
do this. I add, however, a few notices of some of the
tales included in this volume, merely as illustrations
of the way in which they have been built up out of
older materials: like the palaces of the modern
Roman nobility, out of the marbles which were originally
intended to perpetuate the memory of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
victories of the Republic and the magnificence of the
ministers of the Empire.</p>

<p>In the tale which is entitled &lsquo;Justice or Injustice,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
the manner in which the king&rsquo;s daughter is enticed on
ship-board, and carried off with her attendant maidens,
will at once recall the incident related in the opening
paragraph of the history of Herodotus. The resemblance
between the narrative of the abduction of the
daughter of Inachus by the Ph&oelig;nician merchants, and
that in the tale, is so close that it can hardly be accidental.
Some will think that this lends some support
to the notion that the account in Herodotus is mythological;
others that the Serb tale is probably based on
an historical fact. That the tale in this volume is not
of Serbian origin, is evident from the introduction of
the elephants, and the description of their capture after
being intoxicated. The restoration of the hero by
means of &lsquo;the water of life,&rsquo; is an incident common to
very many of these folk-tales, and may fairly be regarded
as a &lsquo;story-radical.&rsquo; In the tale of &lsquo;Bash-Chalek,&rsquo;
this water of life is changed and christianized
into &lsquo;the water of Jordan,&rsquo; whereas in its North Slavonic
variant it is still the &lsquo;water of life&rsquo; which is
retained as the means by which the hero is recalled from
death. In most particulars the Serbian tale closely
follows the Russian type, and may be compared with
the tale which Mr. Ralston has translated under the
title of &lsquo;Marya Morevna.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The &lsquo;True Steel&rsquo; of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
Serbian tale is the Koshchei the Deathless of the
Russian story; and the younger brother of the North
Slavonic story is evidently the Prince Ivan of the South
Slavonic tale. Again, two of the wooers are the same
in both stories, the chief variation being that in the
Serbian folk-tale the raven is introduced instead of the
dragon of the Russian story.</p>

<p>The Bosniac story of &lsquo;The Three Brothers&rsquo; is a good
example of the way in which the expansion of these
stories is effected. We have here three separate
stories thrown into one; the various incidents
of which are to be sought for in a variety
of tales and in different countries. In part the
tale seems to be an echo of the Egyptian story, which,
written on papyrus and believed to be of the date
of the Exodus of the Israelites, is preserved in the
Biblioth&egrave;que Imp&eacute;riale. Of this story, Mr. Goodwin
has given an abstract in the Cambridge Essays of 1858.
The astonishing leap made by the horse of the younger
brother is but an exaggeration of the sufficiently
exaggerated exploit of Buddha&rsquo;s horse, Kantako, which
was thirty-six feet long, was able to go three hundred
miles in one night, and, when impeded by the D&eacute;was,
overcame the obstacles interposed in the way of its
progress by leaping across the river Anoma, a distance
of two hundred and ten feet.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In part, however, the
details of this part of the story accords with the account
of the leap made by the horse Rama Rajah which took
three successive leaps, not only over a wide river, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
also over four thick and tall groves of copal, soparee,
guava, and cocoa-nut trees, as told in the story
of &lsquo;Rama and Luxman.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Again, the iron teeth of the
sister in the Bosniac story make part of the marvels in
the Russian story of &lsquo;The Witch,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and has its counterpart
in the incident of the Syriote story of &lsquo;The
Striga.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The way in which the old woman destroys her
victims by throwing around them a hair of her head is
also common to these folk-tales, and to several which
may be found in the collections of similar tales told in
widely separated countries.</p>

<p>Another of what I have ventured to call &lsquo;primitive
fragments,&rsquo; because commonly made use of in the construction
of the folk-tales of various races, makes its
appearance in the story of &lsquo;The Biter Bit.&rsquo; In that
story the giant demands as his reward that he should
receive what the old man had &lsquo;forgotten at home;&rsquo; and
obtains one of his sons, who had been left behind when
his numerous brothers had set out on their bride-seeking
expedition. This reappears in the Russian tale of &lsquo;The
Water King and Vasilissa the Wise,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and also in the
story of &lsquo;The Youth&rsquo; from the same lands.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> The latter
part of the story resembles the incidents in the Indian
tale of &lsquo;Sringabhuja.&rsquo; In &lsquo;Peppercorn&rsquo; the episode of
the maces which the hero requires, and with which he is
unsatisfied until the third has been made to stand the
test of being thrown into the air and descending on the
forehead of &lsquo;Peppercorn&rsquo; without breaking the mace,
but merely bruising the forehead of the hero, occurs not
only in the Serbian tale of &lsquo;The Bear&rsquo;s Son,&rsquo; but also the
Russian story of &lsquo;Ivan Popyalof,&rsquo; of which Mr. Ralston
has given us a translation; whilst the fraud practised
on &lsquo;Peppercorn&rsquo; by his two companions who leave
him in the deep hole down which he has descended, and
his subsequent adventures both below and on the earth,
are almost identical with incidents in another Russian
folk-tale, &lsquo;The Norka.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

I have noted these various resemblances and borrowings,
or rather variations from one and the same
original, because they illustrate the way in which the
tales found in all parts of the world have been built up
of fragments which are the common property of mankind.
I have not thought it necessary to trace out all
the resemblances to other tales&mdash;all the borrowings
from the common stock. Most of my readers will be
able to do that for themselves. I have but adduced
them by way of example of story-building. They, however,
show us that the stock of original materials out of
which these folk-tales have been constructed is, comparatively
speaking, of but limited extent, and also that
the large number of tales which compose the popular
literature of the world are but evidences of the skill
with which these scanty materials have been combined
by the folk-teachers. The literature of a nation is after
all but the result of the combination of some five-and-twenty
sounds and letters.</p>

<p>In Serbia there is a curious distinction in the use of
prose and rhythm in these folk-stories. Prose is the
vehicle for tales related by women; rhythm the prerogative
of men. Prose stories are usually told in the
domestic circle, and in gatherings of women at Selo or
Prelo. During the summer evenings when field labour
and household occupations have come to a close, it was,
and indeed still is, customary in Serbian villages for
young girls, accompanied by some older female friends,
to gather in groups under the branches of some wide-spreading
tree, and then, whilst the younger people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
occupy themselves in spinning, some of the older women
interest the rest of the company by relating these
traditionary stories. Men are excluded from these
gatherings, and the story-telling which fills up the chief
part of these evenings is looked on as exclusively a
feminine occupation. These stories are always in prose.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, men story-tellers. Their tales or
stories, however, invariably assume the character of
poems, and they are generally&mdash;indeed almost always&mdash;accompanied
by the monotonous sounds of the &ldquo;gusle.&rdquo;
Generally speaking, these poems relate to historical or
mythical incidents in the life of the nation; though
sometimes they are of the same kind as the folk-tales
which are given in this volume, and which are related
in the feminine circle. When this is the case the distinction
already noted is, however, strictly observed.
The folk-tale related by a woman is in prose; the same
tale told by a man is cast into the form of a poem.
Even the purely Christian legends, of which the reader
is presented in this volume with a specimen popular in
Bosnia and the Herz&eacute;govina, &lsquo;The Legend of St.
George,&rsquo; is related with the aid of rhythm. Legends of
the latter kind may have been, as some suppose, originally
related by priests in their churches, and possibly
in prose. Now, however, that they have passed into the
possession of the professional story-tellers they have put
on the masculine garb of verse. This Homeric feature
of Serb customs is indeed now dying out with other
national peculiarities. It is, however, far from being
dead, nor are such verses employed only in celebrating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
the glories of the reign of Stephen Dushan, the heroism
of George Brankovich, or the mournful defeat of
Kossovo. Long tedious debates in the National Parliament,
or Skoupshtina, of 1870, on the liberty of opening
and keeping shops in villages as distinguished from
towns, were summed up and reported throughout the
country in a way which would astonish the readers of
the debates in our English Parliament. The whole discussion,
with the arguments of the various speakers,
took the form of a long song or poem, which was recited
in the open air before the villagers assembled to hear
the course and result of the debate. Perhaps in a
similar manner the military and naval incidents, the
contentions of mighty chiefs, the debates before the
tent of Agamemnon, or in the council-house of Troy,
were thrown into verse by the Father of poetry, the
Prince of story-tellers, or, if the reader holds to the
Wolfian theory, by the professional rhapsodists, and thus
made known throughout Greece in the form of the Iliad.
At any rate we have, in the practice still living in
Serbia, an instance of the way in which a Serbian Homer
would naturally have communicated to his countrymen
all the details of meetings at the council-board and
skirmishes in the plain which diversified the history of
a siege, in the varying fortunes of which their interest
was enlisted.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02" id="chap02"></a>THE BEAR&rsquo;S SON.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time a bear married a woman, and they
had one son. When the boy was yet a little fellow
he begged very hard to be allowed to leave the bear&rsquo;s
cave, and to go out into the world to see what was in it.
His father, however, the Bear, would not consent to this,
saying, &lsquo;You are too young yet, and not strong enough.
In the world there are multitudes of wicked beasts,
called men, who will kill you.&rsquo; So the boy was quieted
for a while, and remained in the cave.</p>

<p>But, after some time, the boy prayed so earnestly that
the Bear, his father, would let him go into the world, that
the Bear brought him into the wood, and showed him
a beech-tree, saying, &lsquo;If you can pull up that beech by
the roots, I will let you go; but if you cannot, then this
is a proof that you are still too weak, and must remain
with me.&rsquo; The boy tried to pull up the tree, but, after
long trying, had to give it up, and go home again to
the cave.</p>

<p>Again some time passed, and he then begged again
to be allowed to go into the world, and his father told
him, as before, if he could pull up the beech-tree he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
might go out into the world. This time the boy pulled
up the tree, so the Bear consented to let him go, first,
however, making him cut away the branches from the
beech, so that he might use the trunk for a club. The
boy now started on his journey, carrying the trunk of
the beech over his shoulder.</p>

<p>One day as the Bear&rsquo;s son was journeying, he came
to a field where he found hundreds of ploughmen working
for their master. He asked them to give him something
to eat, and they told him to wait a bit till their
dinner was brought them, when he should have some&mdash;for,
they said, &lsquo;Where so many are dining one mouth
more or less matters but little.&rsquo; Whilst they were
speaking there came carts, horses, mules, and asses, all
carrying the dinner. But when the meats were spread
out the Bear&rsquo;s son declared he could eat all that up
himself. The workmen wondered greatly at his words,
not believing it possible that one man could consume
as great a quantity of victuals as would satisfy several
hundred men. This, however, the Bear&rsquo;s son persisted
in affirming he could do, and offered to bet with them
that he would do this. He proposed that the stakes
should be all the iron of their ploughshares and other
agricultural implements. To this they assented. No
sooner had they made the wager than he fell upon the
provisions, and in a short time consumed the whole.
Not a fragment was left. Hereupon the labourers, in
accordance with their wager, gave him all the iron
which they possessed.</p>

<p>When the Bear&rsquo;s son had collected all the iron, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
tore up a young birch-tree, twisted it into a band and
tied up the iron into a bundle, which he hung at the
end of his staff, and throwing it across his shoulder,
trudged off from the astonished and affrighted labourers.</p>

<p>Going on a short distance, he arrived at a forge in
which a smith was employed making a ploughshare.
This man he requested to make him a mace with the
iron which he was carrying. This the smith undertook
to do; but putting aside half the iron, he made of
the rest a small, coarsely-finished mace.</p>

<p>Bear&rsquo;s son saw at a glance that he had been cheated
by the smith. Moreover, he was disgusted at the
roughness of the workmanship. He however took it, and
declared his intention of testing it. Then fastening it
to the end of his club and throwing it into the air high
above the clouds he stood still and allowed it to fall on
his shoulder. It had no sooner struck him than the
mace shivered into fragments, some of which fell on
and destroyed the forge. Taking up his staff, Bear&rsquo;s
son reproached the smith for his dishonesty, and killed
him on the spot.</p>

<p>Having collected the whole of the iron, the Bear&rsquo;s
son went to another smithy, and desired the smith
whom he found there to make him a mace, saying to
him, &lsquo;Please play no tricks on me. I bring you these
fragments of iron for you to use in making a mace.
Beware that you do not attempt to cheat me as I was
cheated before!&rsquo; As the smith had heard what had
happened to the other one, he collected his workpeople,
threw all the iron on his fire, and welded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
the whole together and made a large mace of perfect
workmanship.</p>

<p>When it was fastened on the head of his club the
Bear&rsquo;s son, to prove it, threw it up high, and caught it
on his back. This time the mace did not break, but
rebounded. Then the Bear&rsquo;s son got up and said, &lsquo;This
work is well done!&rsquo; and, putting it on his shoulder,
walked away. A little farther on he came to a field
wherein a man was ploughing with two oxen, and he
went up to him and asked for something to eat. The
man said, &lsquo;I expect every moment my daughter to
come with my dinner, then we shall see what God has
given us!&rsquo; The Bear&rsquo;s son told him how he had eaten
up all the dinner prepared for many hundreds of ploughmen,
and asked, &lsquo;From a dinner prepared for one person
how much can come to me or to you?&rsquo; Meanwhile the
girl brought the dinner. The moment she put it down,
Bear&rsquo;s son stretched out his hand to begin to eat, but
the man stopped him. &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you must first
say grace, as I do!&rsquo; The Bear&rsquo;s son, hungry as he was,
obeyed, and, having said grace, they both began to eat.
The Bear&rsquo;s son, looking at the girl who brought the
dinner (she was a tall, strong, beautiful girl), became
very fond of her, and said to the father, &lsquo;Will you give
me your daughter for a wife?&rsquo; The man answered, &lsquo;I
would give her to you very gladly but I have promised
her already to the Moustached.&rsquo; The Bear&rsquo;s son exclaimed,
&lsquo;What do I care for Moustachio? I have my
mace for him!&rsquo; But the man answered, &lsquo;Hush! hush!
Moustachio is also somebody! You will see him here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
soon.&rsquo; Shortly after a noise was heard afar off,
and lo! behind a hill a moustache showed itself, and in
it were three hundred and sixty-five birds&rsquo; nests.
Shortly after appeared the other moustache, and then
came Moustachio himself. Having reached them, he
lay down on the ground immediately, to rest. He put
his head on the girl&rsquo;s knee and told her to scratch his
head a little. The girl obeyed him, and the Bear&rsquo;s son,
getting up, struck him with his club over the head.
Whereupon Moustachio, pointing to the place with his
finger, said, &lsquo;Something bit me here!&rsquo; The Bear&rsquo;s son
struck with his mace on another spot, and Moustachio
again pointed to the place, saying to the girl, &lsquo;Something
has bitten me here!&rsquo; When he was struck a
third time, he said to the girl angrily, &lsquo;Look you!
something bites me here!&rsquo; Then the girl said, &lsquo;Nothing
has bitten you; a man struck you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When Moustachio heard that he jumped up, but
Bear&rsquo;s son had thrown away his mace and ran away.
Moustachio pursued him, and though the Bear&rsquo;s son
was lighter than he, and had gotten the start of him a
considerable distance, he would not give up pursuing
him.</p>

<p>At length the Bear&rsquo;s son, in the course of his flight,
came to a wide river, and found, near it, some men
threshing corn. &lsquo;Help me, my brothers, help&mdash;for
God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; he cried; &lsquo;help! Moustachio is pursuing
me! What shall I do? How can I get across the
river?&rsquo; One of the men stretched out his shovel,
saying, &lsquo;Here! sit down on it, and I will throw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
you over the river!&rsquo; The Bear&rsquo;s son sat on the shovel,
and the man threw him over the water to the other
shore. Soon after Moustachio came up, and asked,
&lsquo;Has any one passed here?&rsquo; The threshers replied that
a man had passed. Moustachio demanded, &lsquo;How did
he cross the river?&rsquo; They answered, &lsquo;He sprang over.&rsquo;
Then Moustachio went back a little to take a start, and
with a hop he sprang to the other side, and continued to
pursue the Bear&rsquo;s son. Meanwhile this last, running
hastily up a hill, got very tired. At the top of the hill
he found a man sowing, and the sack with seeds was
hanging on his neck. After every handful of seed
sown in the ground, the man put a handful in his
mouth and eat them. The Bear&rsquo;s son shouted to him,
&lsquo;Help, brother, help!&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake! Moustachio is
following me, and will soon catch me! Hide me somewhere!&rsquo;
Then the man said, &lsquo;Indeed, it is no joke to
have Moustachio pursuing you. But I have nowhere
to hide you, unless in this sack among the seeds.&rsquo; So
he put him in the sack. When Moustachio came up to
the sower he asked him if he had seen the Bear&rsquo;s son
anywhere? The man replied, &lsquo;Yes, he passed by long
ago, and God knows where he has got before this!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Moustachio went back again. By-and-by the
sower forgot that Bear&rsquo;s son was in his sack, and he took
him out with a handful of seeds, and put him in his
mouth. Then Bear&rsquo;s son was afraid of being swallowed,
so he looked round the mouth quickly, and, seeing a
hollow tooth, hid himself in it.</p>

<p>When the sower returned home in the evening, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
called to his sisters-in-law, &lsquo;Children, give me my toothpick!
There is something in my broken tooth.&rsquo; The
sisters-in-law brought him two iron picks, and, standing
one on each side, they poked about with the two picks
in his tooth till the Bear&rsquo;s son jumped out. Then the
man remembered him, and said, &lsquo;What bad luck you
have! I had nearly swallowed you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After they had taken supper they talked about many
different things, till at last the Bear&rsquo;s son asked what
had happened to break that one tooth, whilst the others
were all strong and healthy. Then the man told him in
these words: &lsquo;Once upon a time ten of us started with
thirty horses to the sea-shore to buy some salt. We
found a girl in a field watching sheep, and she asked us
where we were going. We said we were going to the
sea-shore to buy salt. She said, &ldquo;Why go so far? I
have in the bag in my hand here some salt which remained
over after feeding the sheep. I think it will be
enough for you.&rdquo; So we settled about the price, and
then she took the salt from her bag, whilst we took the
sacks from the thirty horses, and we weighed the salt
and filled the sacks with it till all the thirty sacks were
full. We then paid the girl, and returned home. It
was a very fine autumn day but as we were crossing a
high mountain, the sky became very cloudy and it began
to snow, and there was a cold north wind, so that we
could not see our path and wandered about here and
there. At last, by good luck, one of us shouted, &ldquo;Here,
brothers! Here is a dry place!&rdquo; So we went in one
after the other till we were all, with the thirty horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>30]</a></span>
under shelter. Then we took the sacks from the horses,
made a good fire, and passed the night there as if it were
a house. Next morning, just think what we saw! We
were all in one man&rsquo;s head, which lay in the midst of
some vineyards; and whilst we were yet wondering and
loading our horses, the keeper of the vineyards came
and picked the head up. He put it in a sling and slinging
it about several times, threw it over his head, and
cast it far away over the vines to frighten the starlings
away from his grapes. So we rolled down a hill, and
it was then that I broke my tooth.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap03" id="chap03"></a>THE WONDERFUL KIOSK.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there lived a king, who had three
sons and one daughter. The daughter was kept by
her father for safety in a cage, since he cared for her
as for his own eyes. When the girl grew up, she one
evening asked her father to let her walk a little with
her brothers in the front of the palace, and her father
granted her request. She had hardly, however, taken
a step outside the door of the palace before a dragon
came down, caught her away from her brothers, and
flew up with her into the clouds.</p>

<p>The three brothers ran as quickly as they could,
and told their father what had happened to their sister,
and asked him to let them go in search of her. To this
their father consented, and gave each of them a horse,
and other needful things for their travelling, and they
went away to find their sister. After they had travelled
a long time, they came in sight of a kiosk, which was
neither in the sky nor yet on the earth, but hung mid-way
between both. On coming near it, they began to
think that their sister might be in it, and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
consulted together how they might contrive to reach it.
After much deliberation they settled that one of them
should kill his horse, make a thong out of the hide, and
fastening one end of the thong to an arrow, shoot it
from the bow so that it should strike deep in the side
of the kiosk, and that thus they might be able to climb
up to it. The youngest brother proposed to the eldest
that he should kill his horse, but this he refused to do.
In like manner the second brother refused, so that
nothing remained but that the youngest should kill his
horse, which he did and made a long thong out of the
hide; to this he tied an arrow, which he shot towards
the kiosk.</p>

<p>The question was then asked, who would climb up
the thong? The eldest brother declared that he would
not; the second also refused, and thus it was the
youngest was forced to climb up. When he had reached
the kiosk he went from room to room, until at length
he found his sister sitting with the dragon sleeping with
his head upon her knee, while she passed her fingers
through the hair of his head.</p>

<p>When she saw her brother she was very much
frightened, and made signs for him to go away before
the dragon woke up. But this her brother would not
do, and instead of going away took his mace and struck
with all his might on the head of the dragon. The
dragon moved his paw a little towards the place where
he had been struck, and said to the maiden, &lsquo;I felt something
bite me just here.&rsquo; As he spoke the king&rsquo;s son
gave him another blow, and the dragon said again, &lsquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
felt something bite me just here.&rsquo; When the brother
lifted his mace to strike the third time, the sister
pointed and showed him where to strike at the life of
the dragon. So he struck at the life, and the dragon
immediately fell down dead, and the king&rsquo;s daughter
pushed him from her knee and ran quickly to her
brother and kissed him. Then she took him by the
hand and began to show him the various rooms of the
kiosk.</p>

<p>First, she took him into a room where a black horse
stood ready to be mounted, with all his riding-gear on
him, and the whole of the harness was of pure silver.</p>

<p>She then led him to a second room, and in it stood
a white horse, also saddled and bridled, and his harness
was entirely of pure gold.</p>

<p>At last the sister took her brother into a third room,
and there stood a cream-coloured horse, and the reins
and stirrups and saddle, which were on him, were all
thickly studded with precious stones.</p>

<p>After passing through these three rooms, she led him
to a room where a young maiden sat behind a golden
tambourette, busily engaged in embroidering with
golden thread.</p>

<p>From this room they went into another, where a girl
was spinning gold thread, and again into another room
where a girl sat threading pearls, and before her, on a
golden plate, was a golden hen with her chickens,
sorting the pearls.</p>

<p>Having seen all these things, the brother went back
to the room where the dragon lay dead, and threw him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
down to the earth, and the two brothers, who were below,
were almost frightened to death at the sight of the
dragon&rsquo;s carcass. The young prince then let his sister
slowly down, and, after her, the three young maidens,
each of them with the work on which she was employed.
As he let them down, one after the other, he shouted
to his brothers and told them to whom each of the
maidens should belong&mdash;reserving for himself the third
one, whom he also let down to the ground. This was
the maiden who was engaged in threading pearls with
the help of the golden hen and chickens. His brothers,
however, were envious at the success of his courage, and
at his having found his sister and saved her from the
dragon, so they cut the thong in order that he might
not be able to get down from the kiosk.</p>

<p>Then they found, in the fields near, a young shepherd,
whom they disguised and took to their father, but
forbad their sister and the three maidens, with many
threats, to tell what they had done. After some time
the youngest brother, who had been left in the kiosk,
received the news that his two brothers and the
shepherd were to marry the three maidens. On the
day when his eldest brother was married, the youngest
brother mounted his black horse, and just as the
wedding party came back from the church, the young
prince came down from the kiosk, rushed into the
midst, and struck his eldest brother slightly in the back,
so that he fell down from his horse; he then immediately
flew back again to the kiosk. On the day that
his second brother was married, the youngest again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
came down among the wedding party, as they left the
church. He was mounted on the white horse, and he
struck his second brother as he had done the eldest,
so that he also fell down, and then he returned again
to the kiosk. At last, on hearing that the young
shepherd was going to be married to the maiden whom
the prince had selected for himself, he mounted on the
cream-coloured horse, descended again, and rode among
the wedding guests as they came out of the church,
and struck the bridegroom with his mace on his head
so that he at once fell down dead. When the guests
gathered round him to catch him, which he permitted
them to do, making no attempt to escape from them,
he soon proved to them that he himself was the third
son of the king, and that the shepherd was an imposter,
and that his brothers, out of envy, had left him in the
kiosk, when he had found his sister and killed the
dragon. His sister and the three young maidens confirmed
all that he said, so that the king, in his anger
at the two elder brothers, drove them away from his
court; however, he married the youngest brother to the
third maiden, and, at his death, left him his kingdom.</p>

<h2><a name="chap04" id="chap04"></a>THE SNAKE&rsquo;S GIFT. LANGUAGE OF
ANIMALS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there lived a shepherd who served
his master faithfully and honestly. One day,
whilst keeping the sheep in the forest, he heard a
hissing, and wondered what the noise could be. So he
went farther into the wood to try and find out. There
he saw that the forest was on fire, and a snake was
hissing in the midst of the flames. The shepherd
watched to see what the snake would do, for it was
quite surrounded by the fire, which approached it nearer
and nearer. Then the snake cried out, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,
good shepherd, save me from the fire!&rsquo; So the
shepherd stretched his crook across the flames and the
snake glided rapidly over the staff and up his arm on to
his shoulder, till at last it wound itself round his neck.
Then the shepherd was terrified and exclaimed, &lsquo;What
shall I do? What an unlucky wretch I am! I saved
you, and now you are about to kill me!&rsquo; The snake
answered, &lsquo;Do not be afraid; only take me to the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
of my father. My father is the king of snakes.&rsquo; But
the shepherd, being already in great fear, began to
excuse himself, saying he must not leave his sheep.
Then the snake said, &lsquo;Nothing will happen to your
sheep. Do not be anxious about them. But let us
hurry home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the shepherd went on with the snake through the
forest, until they came to a gate made entirely of snakes.
Then the snake on the neck of the shepherd hissed,
and instantly the snakes untwined themselves, so that
the man could pass through. As soon as they had gone
through, the snake said to him, &lsquo;When you reach my
father&rsquo;s house he will offer to give you whatever you
like&mdash;gold, silver, or precious stones. Do not, however,
take any of these things. Choose, instead,
the language of animals. He will hesitate at first,
but at last he will give it you.&rsquo; Meanwhile they
arrived at the palace, and the king of snakes said,
weeping, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, my child, where were you?&rsquo;
Thereupon the snake told him all that had happened,
how he had been surrounded by fire, and how the shepherd
had saved him. Then the snake king said to the
shepherd, &lsquo;What do you wish that I should give you for
saving my son?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The shepherd answered, &lsquo;I desire nothing but the
language of animals.&rsquo; The snake king, however, said,
&lsquo;That is not good for you, for if I give it you, and you
tell any one about it, you will instantly die. Therefore
it is better that you ask me for something else.&rsquo; &lsquo;If
you wish to give me anything,&rsquo; replied the shepherd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
&lsquo;give me the language of animals; if you will
not give me that, I want nothing&mdash;so good-bye,&rsquo; and
he turned to go away. Then the snake king called him
back, saying, &lsquo;If you indeed wish it so much, take it.
Open your mouth.&rsquo; The shepherd did so, and the snake
king blew into his mouth and said, &lsquo;Now blow once
yourself in my mouth.&rsquo; The shepherd did so, and then
the snake king blew again into his mouth, and this
they did three times. After that the snake said, &lsquo;Now,
you possess the language of animals; go, in God&rsquo;s name,
but do not for the world tell any one about it. If you
tell any one you will instantly die.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The shepherd returned across the forest, and, passing
through it, he understood everything the birds and
animals, and even the plants, were saying to each other.
When he came to his sheep he found them all there,
safe and sound, so he laid himself down to rest a little.
Hardly had he done so before two or three ravens settled
on a tree near him, and began to converse together,
saying, &lsquo;If that shepherd only knew that just on the
spot where the black sheep is lying there is, deep in the
earth, a cave full of gold and silver!&rsquo; When the
shepherd heard that he went off to his master and told
him. The master brought a cart, and dug down to the
cave, and carried the treasure away home. But the
master was honest, so he gave up the whole of the
treasure to the shepherd, saying, &lsquo;Here my son, all this
wealth belongs to you. For to you God gave it. Build
a house, marry, and live upon the treasure.&rsquo; So the
shepherd took the money, built a house, and married,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
and by-and-by he became the richest man in the whole
neighbourhood. He kept his own shepherd, and cattle-driver,
and swineherd; in short, he had great property
and made much money.</p>

<p>Once, just at Christmas, he said to his wife, &lsquo;Get
ready some wine and other food, and to-morrow we will
feast the shepherds.&rsquo; The wife did so, and in the morning
they went to their farm. Towards evening the
master said to the shepherds, &lsquo;Come here, all of you;
you shall eat, drink, and make merry together, and I
will go myself this night to watch the sheep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the master went to watch his sheep, and, about
midnight, the wolves began to howl and the dogs to
bark. The wolves spoke, in wolf language, &lsquo;May we
come and take something? You, also, shall get a part
of the prey.&rsquo; And the dogs answered, in dog language,
&lsquo;Come! we also are ready to eat something.&rsquo; But there
was one old dog there who had only two teeth left.
This old dog shouted furiously, &lsquo;Come on, you miserable
wretches, if you dare. So long as I have these two teeth
left you shall not do any damage to my master&rsquo;s property.&rsquo;
All this the master heard and understood.
Next day he ordered all the dogs to be killed except
that old one. The servants began to remonstrate, saying,
&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, master, it is a pity to do this.&rsquo;
But the master answered, &lsquo;Do as I have ordered you,&rsquo;
and started with his wife to go home. They rode on
horseback, he on a fine horse and his wife on a handsome
mare. But the master&rsquo;s horse went so fast that the
wife remained a little behind. Then the master&rsquo;s horse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
neighed, and said to the mare, &lsquo;Come on, why do you
stay behind?&rsquo; And the mare answered, &lsquo;Ah, to you it
is easy&mdash;you are carrying only one weight, and I am
carrying three.&rsquo; Thereupon the man turned his head
and laughed. The wife saw him laughing, and urged
the mare on quicker till she came up to her husband,
and asked him, &lsquo;Why were you laughing?&rsquo; He said
merely, &lsquo;I had good reason to laugh!&rsquo; But the wife
was not satisfied, and again begged he would tell her
why he laughed. He excused himself, exclaiming,
&lsquo;Give up questioning me; what has come to you, my
wife? I forget now why it was I laughed.&rsquo; But the
more he refused to tell her, the more she wished to
know. At last the man said, &lsquo;If I tell you I shall die
immediately!&rsquo; That, however, did not quiet her, and
she kept on asking, saying to him, &lsquo;You must tell me.&rsquo;
In the meantime they reached their house. When they
had done so the man ordered a coffin to be made, and,
when it was ready, had it placed in front of the house,
and laid himself down in it. Then he said to his wife,
&lsquo;Now I will tell you why I laughed, but the moment I
tell you I shall die.&rsquo; So he looked around once more,
and saw that the old dog had come from the field, and
had taken his stand over his head, and was howling.
When the man noticed this he said to his wife, &lsquo;Bring
a piece of bread for this poor dog.&rsquo; The wife brought
a piece and threw it to the dog, but the dog did not
even look at it, and a cock came near and began to
peck at it.</p>

<p>Then the dog said to the cock, &lsquo;You think only about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
eating. Do you know that our master is going to die?&rsquo;
And the cock answered, &lsquo;Well, let him die, since he is
such a fool. I have a hundred wives, and often at nights
I gather them all round a grain of corn, and, when they
are all there, I pick it up myself. If any of them are
angry, I peck them; that is my way of keeping them
quiet. Only look at the master, however; he is not
able to rule one single wife!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The man, hearing that, got out of the coffin, took a
stick, and called his wife to him, saying, &lsquo;Come now,
and I will tell you what you want to know.&rsquo; The wife,
seeing she was in danger of getting a beating, left him
in peace, and never asked him again why it was he
laughed.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05" id="chap05"></a>THE GOLDEN APPLE-TREE, AND THE NINE
PEAHENS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there lived a king who had three
sons. Now, before the king&rsquo;s palace grew a golden
apple-tree, which in one and the same night blossomed,
bore fruit, and lost all its fruit, though no one could tell
who took the apples. One day the king, speaking to
his eldest son, said, &lsquo;I should like to know who takes
the fruit from our apple-tree!&rsquo; And the son said, &lsquo;I
will keep guard to-night, and will see who gathers the
apples.&rsquo; So when the evening came he went and laid
himself down, under the apple-tree, upon the ground
to watch. Just, however, as the apples ripened, he fell
asleep, and when he awoke in the morning, there was
not a single one left on the tree. Whereupon he went
and told his father what had happened. Then the
second son offered to keep watch by the tree, but he
had no better success than his eldest brother.</p>

<p>So the turn came to the king&rsquo;s youngest son to keep
guard. He made his preparations, brought his bed
under the tree, and immediately went to sleep. Before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
midnight he awoke and looked up at the tree, and saw
how the apples ripened, and how the whole palace was
lit up by their shining. At that minute nine peahens
flew towards the tree, and eight of them settled on its
branches, but the ninth alighted near him and turned
instantly into a beautiful girl&mdash;so beautiful, indeed,
that the whole kingdom could not produce one who could
in any way compare with her. She stayed, conversing
kindly with him, till after midnight, then thanking
him for the golden apples, she prepared to depart;
but, as he begged she would leave him one, she
gave him two, one for himself and one for the
king his father. Then the girl turned again into a
peahen, and flew away with the other eight. Next
morning, the king&rsquo;s son took the two apples to his
father, and the king was much pleased, and praised his
son. When the evening came, the king&rsquo;s youngest son
took his place again under the apple-tree to keep guard
over it. He again conversed as he had done the night
before with the beautiful girl, and brought to his
father, the next morning, two apples as before. But,
after he had succeeded so well several nights, his two
elder brothers grew envious because he had been able
to do what they could not. At length they found an
old woman, who promised to discover how the youngest
brother had succeeded in saving the two apples. So, as
the evening came, the old woman stole softly under the
bed which stood under the apple-tree, and hid herself.
And after a while, came also the king&rsquo;s son, and laid
himself down as usual to sleep. When it was near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
midnight the nine peahens flew up as before, and eight of
them settled on the branches, and the ninth stood by his
bed, and turned into a most beautiful girl.</p>

<p>Then the old woman slowly took hold of one of the
girl&rsquo;s curls, and cut it off, and the girl immediately
rose up, changed again into a peahen and flew away,
and the other peahens followed her, and so they all disappeared.
Then the king&rsquo;s son jumped up, and cried
out, &lsquo;What is that?&rsquo; and, looking under the bed, he
saw the old woman, and drew her out. Next morning
he ordered her to be tied to a horse&rsquo;s tail, and so torn
to pieces. But the peahens never came back, so the
king&rsquo;s son was very sad for a long time, and wept at his
loss. At length he resolved to go and look after his
peahen, and never to come back again unless he
should find her. When he told the king his father of
his intention, the king begged him not to go away, and
said that he would find him another beautiful girl,
and that he might choose out of the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>But all the king&rsquo;s persuasions were useless. His son
went into the world to search everywhere for his peahen,
taking only one servant to serve him. After
many travels he came one day to a lake. Now by the
lake stood a large and beautiful palace. In the palace
lived an old woman as queen, and with the queen
lived a girl, her daughter. He said to the old woman,
&lsquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, grandmother, do you know anything
about nine golden peahens?&rsquo; and the old woman
answered, &lsquo;Oh, my son, I know all about them; they
come every mid-day to bathe in the lake. But what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
do you want with them? Let them be, think nothing
about them. Here is my daughter. Such a beautiful
girl! and such a heiress! All my wealth will remain
to you if you marry her.&rsquo; But he, burning with desire
to see the peahens, would not listen to what the old
woman spoke about her daughter.</p>

<p>Next morning, when day dawned, the prince prepared
to go down to the lake to wait for the peahens.
Then the old queen bribed the servant and gave him a
little pair of bellows, and said, &lsquo;Do you see these bellows?
When you come to the lake you must blow
secretly with them behind his neck, and then he will
fall asleep, and not be able to speak to the peahens.&rsquo;
The mischievous servant did as the old woman told
him; when he went with his master down to the lake,
he took occasion to blow with the bellows behind his
neck, and the poor prince fell asleep just as though he
were dead. Shortly after, the nine peahens came flying,
and eight of them alighted by the lake, but the ninth
flew towards him, as he sat on horseback, and caressed
him, and tried to awaken him. &lsquo;Awake, my darling!
Awake, my heart! Awake, my soul!&rsquo; But for all
that he knew nothing, just as if he were dead. After
they had bathed, all the peahens flew away together,
and after they were gone the prince woke up, and said
to his servant, &lsquo;What has happened? Did they not
come?&rsquo; The servant told him they had been there, and
that eight of them had bathed, but the ninth had sat
by him on his horse, and caressed and tried to awaken
him. Then the king&rsquo;s son was so angry that he almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
killed himself in his rage. Next morning he went
down again to the shore to wait for the peahens, and
rode about a long time till the servant again found an
opportunity of blowing with the bellows behind his
neck, so that he again fell asleep as though dead.
Hardly had he fallen asleep when the nine peahens
came flying, and eight of them alighted by the water,
but the ninth settled down by the side of his horse and
caressed him, and cried out to awaken him, &lsquo;Arise, my
darling! Arise, my heart! Arise, my soul!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But it was of no use; the prince slept on as if he
were dead. Then she said to the servant, &lsquo;Tell your
master to-morrow he can see us here again, but never
more.&rsquo; With these words the peahens flew away.
Immediately after the king&rsquo;s son woke up, and asked his
servant, &lsquo;Have they not been here?&rsquo; And the man
answered, &lsquo;Yes, they have been, and say that you can
see them again to-morrow, at this place, but after that
they will not return again.&rsquo; When the unhappy prince
heard that, he knew not what to do with himself, and
in his great trouble and misery tore the hair from his
head.</p>

<p>The third day he went down again to the shore,
but, fearing to fall asleep, instead of riding slowly,
galloped along the shore. His servant, however, found
an opportunity of blowing with the bellows behind his
neck, and again the prince fell asleep. A moment
after came the nine peahens, and the eight alighted on
the lake and the ninth by him, on his horse, and sought
to awaken him, caressing him. &lsquo;Arise, my darling!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
Arise, my heart! Arise, my soul!&rsquo; But it was of no
use, he slept on as if dead. Then the peahen said to
the servant, &lsquo;When your master awakens tell him he
ought to strike off the head of the nail from the lower
part, and then he will find me.&rsquo; Thereupon all the
peahens fled away. Immediately the king&rsquo;s son awoke,
and said to his servant, &lsquo;Have they been here?&rsquo; And
the servant answered, &lsquo;They have been, and the one
which alighted on your horse, ordered me to tell you to
strike off the head of the nail from the lower part, and
then you will find her.&rsquo; When the prince heard that,
he drew his sword and cut off his servant&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>After that he travelled alone about the world, and,
after long travelling, came to a mountain and remained
all night there with a hermit, whom he asked if he
knew anything about nine golden peahens. The hermit
said, &lsquo;Eh! my son, you are lucky; God has led
you in the right path. From this place it is only half
a day&rsquo;s walk. But you must go straight on, then you
will come to a large gate, which you must pass through;
and, after that, you must keep always to the right hand,
and so you will come to the peahens&rsquo; city, and there find
their palace.&rsquo; So next morning the king&rsquo;s son arose,
and prepared to go. He thanked the hermit, and went
as he had told him. After a while he came to the great
gate, and, having passed it, turned to the right, so that
at mid-day he saw the city, and beholding how white
it shone, rejoiced very much. When he came into the
city he found the palace where lived the nine golden
peahens. But at the gate he was stopped by the guard,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
who demanded who he was, and whence he came. After
he had answered these questions, the guards went to
announce him to the queen. When the queen heard
who he was, she came running out to the gate and took
him by the hand to lead him into the palace. She was
a young and beautiful maiden, and so there was a great
rejoicing when, after a few days, he married her and
remained there with her.</p>

<p>One day, some time after their marriage, the queen
went out to walk, and the king&rsquo;s son remained in the
palace. Before going out, however, the queen gave
him the keys of twelve cellars, telling him, &lsquo;You may
go down into all the cellars except the twelfth&mdash;that
you must on no account open, or it will cost you your
head.&rsquo; She then went away. The king&rsquo;s son whilst
remaining in the palace began to wonder what there
could be in the twelfth cellar, and soon commenced
opening one cellar after the other. When he came
to the twelfth he would not at first open it, but again
began to wonder very much why he was forbidden to
go into it. &lsquo;What <em>can</em> be in this cellar?&rsquo; he exclaimed
to himself. At last he opened it. In the
middle of the cellar lay a big barrel with an open bung-hole,
but bound fast round with three iron hoops. Out
of the barrel came a voice, saying, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,
my brother&mdash;I am dying with thirst&mdash;please give me a
cup of water!&rsquo; Then the king&rsquo;s son took a cup and
filled it with water, and emptied it into the barrel.
Immediately he had done so one of the hoops burst
asunder. Again came the voice from the barrel, &lsquo;For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
God&rsquo;s sake, my brother&mdash;I am dying of thirst&mdash;please
give me a cup of water!&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son again filled
the cup, and took it, and emptied it into the barrel,
and instantly another hoop burst asunder. The third
time the voice came out of the barrel, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,
my brother&mdash;I am dying of thirst&mdash;please give me a
cup of water!&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son again took the cup and
filled it, and poured the water into the barrel&mdash;and the
third hoop burst. Then the barrel fell to pieces, and
a dragon flew out of the cellar, and caught the queen
on the road and carried her away.</p>

<p>Then the servant, who went out with the queen,
came back quickly, and told the king&rsquo;s son what had
happened, and the poor prince knew not what to do
with himself, so desperate was he, and full of self-reproaches.
At length, however, he resolved to set out
and travel through the world in search of her. After
long journeying, one day he came to a lake, and near
it, in a little hole, he saw a little fish jumping about.
When the fish saw the king&rsquo;s son, she began to beg
pitifully, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, be my brother, and throw
me into the water. Some day I may be of use to you,
so take now a little scale from me, and when you need
me, rub it gently.&rsquo; Then the king&rsquo;s son lifted the
little fish from the hole and threw her into the water,
after he had taken one small scale, which he wrapped
up carefully in a handkerchief. Some time afterwards,
as he travelled about the world, he came upon a fox,
caught in an iron trap. When the fox saw the prince,
he spoke: &lsquo;In God&rsquo;s name, be a brother to me, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
help me to get out of this trap. One day you will
need me, so take just one hair from my tail, and when
you want me, rub it gently.&rsquo; Then the king&rsquo;s son took
a hair from the tail of the fox, and let him free.</p>

<p>Again, as he crossed a mountain, he found a wolf
fast in a trap; and when the wolf saw him, it spoke:
&lsquo;Be a brother to me; in God&rsquo;s name, set me free, and
one day I will help you. Only take a hair from me,
and when you need me, rub it gently.&rsquo; So he took a
hair, and let the wolf free. After that, the king&rsquo;s son
travelled about a very long time, till one day he met a
man, to whom he said, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, brother, have
you ever heard any one say where is the palace of the
dragon king?&rsquo; The man gave him very particular
directions which way to take, and in what length of
time he could get there. Then the king&rsquo;s son thanked
him and continued his journey until he came to the
city where the dragon lived. When there, he went into
the palace and found therein his wife, and both of them
were exceedingly pleased to meet each other, and
began to take counsel how they could escape. They resolved
to run away, and prepared hastily for the
journey. When all was ready they mounted on horseback
and galloped away. As soon as they were gone
the dragon came home, also on horseback, and, entering
his palace, found that the queen had gone away. Then
he said to his horse, &lsquo;What shall we do now? Shall
we eat and drink, or go at once after them?&rsquo; The
horse answered, &lsquo;Let us eat and drink first, we shall
anyway catch them; do not be anxious.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
After the dragon had dined he mounted his horse,
and in a few moments came up with the runaways.
Then he took the queen from the king&rsquo;s son and said
to him, &lsquo;Go now, in God&rsquo;s name! This time I forgive
you because you gave me water in the cellar; but if
your life is dear to you do not come back here any
more!&rsquo; The unhappy young prince went on his way a
little, but could not long resist, so he came back next
day to the dragon&rsquo;s palace, and found the queen sitting
alone and weeping. Then they began again to consult
how they could get away. And the prince said, &lsquo;When
the dragon comes, ask him where he got that horse, and
then you will tell me so that I can look for such another
one; perhaps in this way we can escape.&rsquo; He then
went away, lest the dragon should come and find him
with the queen.</p>

<p>By-and-by the dragon came home, and the queen
began to pet him, and speak lovingly to him about
many things, till at last she said, &lsquo;Ah! what a fine
horse you have! where did you get such a splendid
horse?&rsquo; And he answered, &lsquo;Eh! where I got it every
one cannot get one! In such and such a mountain
lives an old woman who has twelve horses in her stable,
and no one can say which is the finest, they are all so
beautiful. But in one corner of the stable stands a
horse which looks as if he were leprous, but, in truth,
he is the very best horse in the whole world. He is
the brother of my horse, and whoever gets him may ride
to the sky. But whoever wishes to get a horse from
that old woman, must serve her three days and three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
nights. She has a mare with a foal, and whoever
during three nights guards and keeps for her this mare
and this foal, has a right to claim the best horse from
the old woman&rsquo;s stable. But whoever engages to keep
watch over the mare and does not, must lose his head!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Next day, when the dragon went out, the king&rsquo;s son
came, and the queen told him all she had learned from
the dragon. Then the king&rsquo;s son went away to the
mountain and found the old woman, and entered her
house greeting: &lsquo;God help you, grandmother!&rsquo; And
she answered, &lsquo;God help you, too, my son! what do
you wish?&rsquo; &lsquo;I should like to serve you,&rsquo; said the king&rsquo;s
son. Then the old woman said, &lsquo;Well, my son, if you
keep my mare safe for three days and three nights I
will give you the best horse, and you can choose him
yourself; but if you do not keep the mare safe you
shall lose your head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then she led him into the courtyard, where all around
stakes were ranged. Each of them had on it a man&rsquo;s
head, except one stake, which had no head on it, and
shouted incessantly, &lsquo;Oh, grandmother, give me a
head!&rsquo; The old woman showed all this to the prince,
and said, &lsquo;Look here! all these were heads of those who
tried to keep my mare, and they have lost their heads
for their pains!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the prince was not a bit afraid, so he stayed to
serve the old woman. When the evening came he
mounted the mare and rode her into the field, and the
foal followed. He sat still on her back, having made
up his mind not to dismount, that he might be sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
of her. But before midnight he slumbered a little, and
when he awoke he found himself sitting on a rail and
holding the bridle in his hand. Then he was greatly
alarmed, and went instantly to look about to find the
mare, and whilst looking for her, he came to a piece
of water. When he saw the water he remembered the
little fish, and took the scale from the handkerchief and
rubbed it a little. Then immediately the little fish appeared
and said, &lsquo;What is the matter, my half-brother?&rsquo;
And he replied, &lsquo;The mare of the old woman ran away
whilst under my charge, and now I do not know where
she is!&rsquo; And the fish answered, &lsquo;Here she is, turned
to a fish, and the foal to a smaller one. But strike once
upon the water with the bridle and cry out, &ldquo;Heigh!
mare of the old woman!&rdquo;&rsquo; The prince did as he was
told, and immediately the mare came, with the foal,
out of the water to the shore. Then he put on her the
bridle and mounted and rode away to the old woman&rsquo;s
house, and the foal followed. When he got there the
old woman gave him his breakfast; she, however, took
the mare into the stable and beat her with a poker,
saying, &lsquo;Why did you not go down among the fishes,
you cursed mare?&rsquo; And the mare answered, &lsquo;I have
been down to the fishes, but the fish are his friends and
they told him about me.&rsquo; Then the old woman said,
&lsquo;Then go among the foxes!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When evening came the king&rsquo;s son mounted the mare
and rode to the field, and the foal followed the mare.
Again he sat on the mare&rsquo;s back until near midnight,
when he fell asleep as before. When he awoke, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
found himself riding on the rail and holding the bridle
in his hand. So he was much frightened, and went to
look after the mare. As he went he remembered the
words the old woman had said to the mare, and he took
from the handkerchief the fox&rsquo;s hair and rubbed it a
little between his fingers. All at once the fox stood
before him, and asked, &lsquo;What is the matter, half-brother?&rsquo;
And he said, &lsquo;The old woman&rsquo;s mare has
run away, and I do not know where she can be.&rsquo; Then
the fox answered, &lsquo;Here she is with us; she has turned
into a fox, and the foal into a cub; but strike once with
the bridle on the earth and cry out, &ldquo;Heigh! you old
woman&rsquo;s mare!&rdquo;&rsquo; So the king&rsquo;s son struck with the
bridle on the earth and cried, &lsquo;Heigh! old woman&rsquo;s
mare!&rsquo; and the mare came and stood, with her foal,
near him. He put on the bridle, and mounted and rode
off home, and the foal followed the mare. When he
arrived the old woman gave him his breakfast, but took
the mare into the stable and beat her with the poker,
crying, &lsquo;To the foxes, cursed one! to the foxes!&rsquo; And
the mare answered, &lsquo;I have been with the foxes, but
they are his friends, and told him I was there!&rsquo; Then
the old woman cried, &lsquo;If that is so, you must go among
the wolves!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When it grew dark again the king&rsquo;s son mounted the
mare and rode out to the field, and the foal galloped by
the side of the mare. Again he sat still on the mare&rsquo;s
back till about midnight, when he grew very sleepy
and fell into a slumber, as on the former evenings, and
when he awoke he found himself riding on the rail,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
holding the bridle in his hand, just as before. Then,
as before, he went in a hurry to look after the mare.
As he went he remembered the words the old woman
had said to the mare, and took the wolf&rsquo;s hair from the
handkerchief and rubbed it a little. Then the wolf
came up to him and asked, &lsquo;What is the matter, half-brother?&rsquo;
And he answered, &lsquo;The old woman&rsquo;s mare
has run away, and I cannot tell where she is.&rsquo; The
wolf said, &lsquo;Here she is with us; she has turned herself
into a wolf, and the foal into a wolf&rsquo;s cub. Strike once
with the bridle on the earth and cry out, &ldquo;Heigh! old
woman&rsquo;s mare!&rdquo;&rsquo; And the king&rsquo;s son did so, and instantly
the mare came again and stood with the foal beside
him. So he bridled her, and galloped home, and
the foal followed. When he arrived the old woman
gave him his breakfast, but she led the mare into the
stable and beat her with the poker, crying, &lsquo;To the
wolves, I said, miserable one!&rsquo; Then the mare answered,
&lsquo;I have been to the wolves; but they are his
friends, and told him all about me!&rsquo; Then the old
woman came out of the stable, and the king&rsquo;s son said
to her, &lsquo;Eh! grandmother, I have served you honestly;
now give me what you promised me.&rsquo; And the old
woman answered, &lsquo;My son, what is promised must be
fulfilled. So look here: here are the twelve horses,
choose which you like!&rsquo; And the prince said, &lsquo;Why
should I be too particular? Give me only that leprous
horse in the corner! fine horses are not fitting for me!&rsquo;
But the old woman tried to persuade him to choose
another horse, saying, &lsquo;How can you be so foolish as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
choose that leprous thing whilst there are such very
fine horses here?&rsquo; But he remained firm by his first
choice, and said to the old woman, &lsquo;You ought to give
me which I choose, for so you promised.&rsquo; So, when
the old woman found she could not make him change
his mind, she gave him the scabby horse, and he took
leave of her, and went away, leading the horse by the
halter.</p>

<p>When he came to a forest he curried and rubbed
down the horse, when it shone as bright as gold. He
then mounted, and the horse flew as quickly as a bird,
and in a few seconds brought him to the dragon&rsquo;s
palace. The king&rsquo;s son went in and said to the queen,
&lsquo;Get ready as soon as possible!&rsquo; She was soon ready,
when they both mounted the horse, and began their
journey home. Soon after the dragon came home, and
when he saw the queen had disappeared, said to his
horse, &lsquo;What shall we do? Shall we eat and drink
first, or shall we pursue them at once?&rsquo; The horse
answered, &lsquo;Whether we eat and drink or not it is all
one, we shall never reach them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the dragon heard that, he got quickly on his
horse and galloped after them. When they saw the
dragon following them they pushed on quicker, but
their horse said, &lsquo;Do not be afraid! there is no need
to run away.&rsquo; In a very few moments the dragon
came very near to them, and his horse said to their
horse, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, my brother, wait a moment! I
shall kill myself running after you!&rsquo; Their horse answered,
&lsquo;Why are you so stupid as to carry that monster.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
Fling your heels up and throw him off, and come along
with me!&rsquo; When the dragon&rsquo;s horse heard that he
shook his head angrily and flung his feet high in the
air, so that the dragon fell off and brake in pieces, and
his horse came up to them. Then the queen mounted
him and returned with the king&rsquo;s son happily to her
kingdom, where they reigned together in great prosperity
until the day of their death.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>S some village girls were spinning whilst they
tended the cattle grazing in the neighbourhood
of a ravine, an old man with a long white beard&mdash;so
long a beard that it reached to his girdle&mdash;approached
them, and said, &lsquo;Girls, girls, take care of
that ravine! If one of you should drop her spindle
down the cliff, her mother will be turned into a cow
that very moment!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Having warned them thus, the old man went away
again. The girls, wondering very much at what he
had told them, came nearer and nearer to the ravine,
and leant over to look in; whilst doing so one of the
girls&mdash;and she the most beautiful of them all&mdash;let her
spindle fall from her hand, and it fell to the bottom of
the ravine.</p>

<p>When she went home in the evening she found her
mother, changed into a cow, standing before the house;
and from that time forth she had to drive this cow to
the pasture with the other cattle.</p>

<p>In a little time the father of the girl married a
widow, who brought with her into the house her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
daughter. The stepmother immediately began to
hate the step-daughter, because the girl was incomparably
more beautiful than her own daughter. She
forbade her to wash herself, to comb her hair, or to
change her clothes, and sought by every possible way
to torment and scold her. One day she gave her a bag
full of hemp, and said, &lsquo;If you do not spin all this well
and wind it, you need not return home, for if you do I
shall kill you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor girl walked behind the cattle and spun as
fast as possible; but at mid-day, seeing how very little
she had been able to spin, she began to weep. When
the cow, her mother, saw her weeping, she asked her
what was the matter, and the girl told her all about it.
Then the cow consoled her, and told her not to be
anxious. &lsquo;I will take the hemp in my mouth and chew
it,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and it will come out of my ear as thread,
so that you can draw it out and wind it at once upon
the stick;&rsquo; and so it happened. The cow began to chew
the hemp and the girl drew the thread from her ear and
wound it, so that very soon they had quite finished the
task.</p>

<p>When the girl went home in the evening, and took
all the hemp, worked up, to her stepmother, she was
greatly astonished, and next morning gave her yet more
hemp to spin and wind. When at night she brought
that home ready the stepmother thought she must be
helped by some other girls, her friends; therefore the
third day she gave her much more hemp than before.
But when the girl had gone with the cow to the pasture,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
the woman sent her own daughter after her to find out
who was helping her. This girl went quietly towards
her step-sister so as not to be heard, and saw the cow
chewing the hemp and the girl drawing the thread
from her ear and winding it, so she hastened home and
told all to her mother. Then the stepmother urged the
husband to kill the cow. At first he resisted; but,
seeing his wife would give him no peace, he at last
consented to do as she wished, and fixed the day on
which he would kill it. As soon as the step-daughter
heard this she began to weep, and when the cow asked
her why she wept she told her all about it. But the
cow said, &lsquo;Be quiet! do not cry! Only when they kill
me take care not to eat any of the meat, and be sure to
gather all my bones and bury them behind the house,
and whenever you need anything come to my grave and
you will find help.&rsquo; So when they killed the cow the
girl refused to eat any of the flesh, saying she was not
hungry, and afterwards carefully gathered all the bones
and buried them behind the house, on the spot the cow
had told her.</p>

<p>The real name of this girl was Mary, but as she had
worked so much in the house, carrying water, cooking,
washing dishes, sweeping the house, and doing all
sorts of house-work, and had very much to do about
the fire and cinders, her stepmother and half-sister
called her &lsquo;Papalluga&rsquo; (Cinderella).</p>

<p>One day the stepmother got ready to go with her own
daughter to church, but before she went she spread
over the house a basketful of millet, and said to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
step-daughter, &lsquo;You Papalluga! If you do not gather
up all this millet and get the dinner ready before we
come back from church, I will kill you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When they had gone to church the poor girl began
to weep, saying to herself: &lsquo;It is easy to see after the
dinner; I shall soon have that ready; but who can
gather up all this quantity of millet!&rsquo; At that moment
she remembered what the cow had told her, that in
case of need she should go to her grave and would there
find help, so she ran quickly to the spot, and what
do you think she saw there? On the grave stood a
large box full of valuable clothes of different kinds,
and on the top of the box sat two white doves, who
said, &lsquo;Mary, take out of this box the clothes which you
like best and put them on, and then go to church;
meanwhile we will pick up the millet seeds and put
everything in order.&rsquo; The girl was greatly pleased,
and took the first clothes which came to hand. These
were all of silk, and having put them on she went away
to church. In the church every one, men and women,
wondered much at her beauty and her splendid clothes,
but no one knew who she was or whence she came. The
king&rsquo;s son, who happened to be there, looked at her
all the time and admired her greatly. Before the service
was ended she stood up and quietly left the church.
She then ran away home, and as soon as she got
there took off her fine clothes and again laid them in
the box, which instantly shut itself and disappeared.</p>

<p>Then she hurried to the hearth and found the dinner
quite ready, all the millet gathered up, and everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
in very good order. Soon after the stepmother came
back with her daughter from the church, and was extremely
surprised to find all the millet picked up and
everything so well arranged.</p>

<p>Next Sunday the stepmother and her daughter again
dressed themselves to go to church, and, before she went
away, the stepmother threw much more millet about the
floor, and said to her step-daughter, &lsquo;If you do not
gather up all this millet, prepare the dinner, and get
everything into the best order, I shall kill you.&rsquo; When
they were gone, the girl instantly ran to her mother&rsquo;s
grave, and there found the box open as before, with
the two doves sitting on its lid. The doves said to
her, &lsquo;Dress yourself, Mary, and go to church; we will
pick up all the millet and arrange everything.&rsquo; Then
she took from the box silver clothes, and having dressed
herself, went to church. In the church everyone, as
before, admired her very much, and the king&rsquo;s son never
moved his eyes from her. Just before the end of the
service the girl again got up very quietly and stole
through the crowd. When she got out of church she
ran away very quickly, took off the clothes, laid them
in the box, and went into the kitchen. When the
stepmother and her daughter came home, they were
more surprised than before; the millet was gathered
up, dinner was ready, and everything in the very best
order. They wondered very much how it was all
done.</p>

<p>On the third Sunday the stepmother dressed herself
to go with her daughter to church, and again scattered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
millet about on the ground, but this time far more than
on the other Sundays. Before she went out she said
to her step-daughter, &lsquo;If you do not gather up all this
millet, prepare the dinner, and have everything in
order when I come from church, I will kill you!&rsquo; The
instant they were gone, the girl ran to her mother&rsquo;s
grave, and found the box open with the two white doves
sitting on the lid. The doves told her to dress herself
and go to church, and to have no care about the millet
or dinner.</p>

<p>This time she took clothes of all real gold out of the
box, and, having put them on, went away to the church.
In the church all the people looked at her and admired
her exceedingly. Now the king&rsquo;s son had resolved not
to let her slip away as before, but to watch where she
went. So, when the service was nearly ended, and she
stood up to leave the church, the king&rsquo;s son followed
her, but was not able to reach her. In pushing through
the crowd, however, Mary somehow in her hurry lost
the slipper from her right foot and had no time to look
for it. This slipper the king&rsquo;s son found, and took care
of it. When the girl got home she took off the golden
clothes and laid them in the box, and went immediately
to the fire in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s son, having determined to find the maiden,
went all over the kingdom, and tried the slipper on
every girl, but in some cases it was too long, in others
too short, and, in fact, it did not fit any of them. As he
was thus going about from one house to the other, the
king&rsquo;s son came at last to the house of the girl&rsquo;s father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
and the stepmother, seeing the king&rsquo;s son coming, hid
her step-daughter in a wash-trough before the house.
When the king&rsquo;s son came in with the slipper and
asked if there were any girl in the house, the woman
answered &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; and brought out her own daughter.
But when the slipper was tried it was found it would
not go even over the girl&rsquo;s toes. Then the king&rsquo;s son
asked if no other girl was there, and the stepmother
said, &lsquo;No, there is no other in the house.&rsquo; At that
moment the cock sprung upon the wash-trough, and
crowed out &lsquo;Cock-a-doodle-do!&mdash;here she is under the
wash-trough!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The stepmother shouted, &lsquo;Go away! may the eagle
fly away with you!&rsquo; But the king&rsquo;s son, hearing that,
hurried to the wash-trough, and lifted it up, and what
did he see there! The same girl who had been in the
church, in the same golden clothes in which she had
appeared the third time there, but lying under the
trough, and with only one slipper on. When the king&rsquo;s
son saw her, he nearly lost his senses for the moment,
he was so very glad. Then he quickly tried to place the
slipper he carried on her right foot, and it fitted her
exactly, besides perfectly matching with the other
slipper on her left foot. Then he took her away with
him to his palace and married her.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07" id="chap07"></a>THE GOLDEN-FLEECED RAM.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time a hunter went to the mountains
to hunt, and met there a golden-fleeced ram. The
moment he saw it he took up his rifle to shoot it; before,
however, he could do so, the ram rushed at him
and killed him with its horns. His friends found him
lying dead, and took him home and buried him, without
knowing how he had been killed. The hunter&rsquo;s wife
hung up his rifle on a nail. When her son grew old
enough, he one day asked his mother for the rifle, that
he might go hunting. The mother, however, refused
to give it him. &lsquo;Nothing in the world, my son,&rsquo; cried
she, &lsquo;shall induce me to do so. Your father lost his
life through that gun, and do you wish, also, to lose
your life because of it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>However the youth managed to steal the rifle one
day, and went away to the mountains to hunt. When
he came to the forest, the golden-fleeced ram appeared
also to him, and said, &lsquo;I killed your father, and I will
kill you!&rsquo; The son was shocked, and said, &lsquo;God help
me!&rsquo; Then he levelled at the ram with the rifle and
killed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
Greatly rejoiced that he had killed the golden-fleeced
ram, (for there was not another like it in all the kingdom)
he now took the fleece home. In a very short time
the news of this spread all over the country, and
reached even the king&rsquo;s ears. Then the king ordered
the young lad to bring the ram&rsquo;s fleece to him, that he
might see what different animals lived in his kingdom.
When the young lad took it to the king, and
exhibited it, the king asked, &lsquo;How much money do you
want for that fleece?&rsquo; To which the young man answered,
&lsquo;I will not sell it for any money.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the king&rsquo;s first minister happened to be the
uncle of the young man; instead, however, of being
his friend, he was his greatest enemy. So the minister
said to the king, &lsquo;If he will not give you the fleece,
set him something to do which will cost him his life.
The best plan would be to order him to do something
which it is impossible for him to do.&rsquo; Accordingly he
advised the king to order the young man to plant a
vineyard, and to bring him, within seven days, new
wine from it. The young man hearing this, began to
weep, and begged to be excused from such a task as he
could not work a miracle. But the king said, &lsquo;If you
don&rsquo;t do that in seven days, you shall lose your life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the youth returned weeping to his mother, and
told her about it. And the mother said, &lsquo;Did I not
tell you, my son, that the golden fleece would cost you
your life as it cost your father his?&rsquo; Weeping and
wondering what to do, since he got no rest at home, he
thus walked out of the village a good distance, when,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
suddenly, a little girl appeared before him and said,
&lsquo;Why are you weeping, my brother?&rsquo; He answered,
somewhat angrily, &lsquo;Go your way, in God&rsquo;s name! you
cannot help me.&rsquo; He then went on his way, but the
little girl followed him, and begged much that he would
tell her why he wept, &lsquo;for, perhaps,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I may
be able to help you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, then, I will tell you,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;though I am sure no one except God can help
me.&rsquo; So he told her all that had happened to him, and
what the king had ordered him to do. When she had
heard all, she said, &lsquo;Be not tearful, my brother, but go
and demand from the king that he should appoint the
place where the vineyard shall be planted, and order
it to be dug in straight lines; then go yourself, and
take a sack, with a branch of basilicum in it, and lie
down to sleep in the place where the vineyard has been
marked out. Take courage! Don&rsquo;t be afraid! In
seven days you will have ripe grapes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon he returned home and told his mother how
he had met the little girl, and what she had told him;
not, however, as having any belief in what she had said.
The mother, however, when she had heard his words,
said, &lsquo;Go, my son, and try; anyhow you are a lost man.
You can but try.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went then to the king and demanded land for
the vineyard, and begged that it should be dug in
straight rows. The king ordered everything to be done
as the young man demanded, who forthwith took a sack
on his shoulder, and a sprig of basilicum, and went
full of fear and sorrow to lie down in the place. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
he awoke next morning the vines were already planted;
the second morning the leaves were on the vines; and,
in short, on the seventh day there were ripe grapes, and
that, too, in a season when grapes were to be found
nowhere else.</p>

<p>He gathered some grapes, and made sweet wine; and
took also a cluster of grapes in a handkerchief, and
went to the king.</p>

<p>The king and the whole court were exceedingly surprised,
but the young man&rsquo;s uncle said, &lsquo;Now we will
order him to do something which it is quite impossible
that he should do.&rsquo; He then advised the king to call
the young man, and order him to make a palace of
elephants&rsquo; tusks.</p>

<p>The young man heard the king&rsquo;s order, and went
home weeping. He told his mother the order which the
king had given him, and said, &lsquo;Mother, this is a task
which neither I nor any one else can fulfil.&rsquo; Then the
mother advised him to take a walk beyond the village.
&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you will again meet the little girl.&rsquo;
Accordingly he went; and when he reached the place
where he had before seen the maiden, she again appeared
to him, and said, &lsquo;You are sad and troubled as
before, my brother.&rsquo; Then he told her what a task the
king had set him to perform. She, however, no sooner
heard this than she said, &lsquo;This will also be easy; but
first go to the king, and demand from him a ship with
three hundred barrels of wine, and three hundred barrels
of brandy, and twenty carpenters. Then, when you
arrive at a place which you will find between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
mountains, dam up the water there, and pour into it the
wine and the brandy. The elephants will soon come
there to drink water, and will get drunk and fall down.
Then your twenty carpenters must cut off their tusks,
and carry them to the spot where the king desires to
have the palace built. Then lie down there to sleep,
and in seven days the palace will be ready.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man returned home and told his mother
what the young maiden had said to him. The mother
advised him to follow the girl&rsquo;s counsel. &lsquo;Go, my son,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;perhaps God will again help you.&rsquo; So the
young man went to the king, and demanded the barrels
of wine and brandy, and the twenty carpenters. The
king furnished him with all he desired; and he went
immediately where the girl had told him, and did as
she had ordered. And, even as she had foretold, the
elephants came to drink, and got tipsy, and fell down;
and the carpenters sawed their tusks, and carried them
to the spot where the palace was to be built. Then, at
evening, the young man took his sack and a branch of
basilicum, and went and lay down to sleep in the
place.</p>

<p>And on the seventh day the palace was ready. When
the king saw it, he marvelled, and said to his first
minister, the uncle of the young man, &lsquo;Now what
shall we do with him? Indeed he is not a man; God
knows only what he is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To this, the minister answered, &lsquo;Yet one thing you
ought to order him to do, and if he fulfils that, also,
indeed he must be something more than man.&rsquo; So, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
accordance with the advice of his minister, the king
called the young man again, and said, &lsquo;Now, go and
bring me the king&rsquo;s daughter from such and such a
kingdom, and out of such a city. If you should fail
to bring her, you will lose your head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man went home and told his mother the
new task which the king had set him to do, and the
mother said, &lsquo;Go, my son, and look for that young
maiden. Perhaps God will grant that she may save
you a third time!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So, as before, he went outside the village, and met
the young maiden, and told her what he had now to do.</p>

<p>The girl listened to him, and then said, &lsquo;Go and
demand from the king a ship; in the ship must be
made twenty shops, and in each shop must be a different
kind of ware, each one better than the other.
Then demand that the twenty handsomest young men
should be chosen, and finely dressed, and put one in
each shop as salesman. Then sail yourself with the
ship, and you will first meet a man who carries a large
eagle. You must ask him if he will sell it you, and he
will answer &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Then give him anything he demands
in return for the eagle. After that you will
meet a man carrying in his fishing-net a carp with
golden scales; you must buy the carp, whatever it may
cost you. Thirdly, you will meet a man carrying a live
dove, and this dove you must also buy, whatever the
price may be. Then, take a feather from the eagle&rsquo;s
tail, a scale from the carp, and a little feather from the
left wing of the dove, and let the eagle, carp, and dove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
go away free. When you arrive in the kingdom, and
at the city where the princess resides, you must open
all the twenty shops, and order each young man to
stand before his shop-door. Then the citizens will
come and admire the wares; and the maidens, who
come to fetch water, will go back into the city and say,
&ldquo;Such a ship and such wares were never before seen
since this was a city!&rdquo; This news will reach the ears
of the king&rsquo;s daughter, and she will beg permission from
her father to go and see the ship herself. When she
comes, with her friends, on board, you must lead her
from one shop to the other, and bring out and show her
the finest wares which you have. Thus you must contrive
to engage her attention and to keep her on board
till it gets dusk, and then let the ship sail. In that
moment it will be so dark that nothing can be seen.
The girl will have a bird on her shoulder, and, when
she sees the ship is sailing away, she will let the bird
fly to take tiding to the palace of what has happened
to her. Then you must burn the eagle&rsquo;s plume, and the
old eagle will instantly come to you. You must order
him to catch the bird, and he will quickly do so. Then
the girl will throw a small stone into the water, and
the ship will at once stand still; but you will immediately
burn the carp&rsquo;s scale, and the carp will come to
you. You must order him to find and swallow that little
water of life, and when he does so the ship will sail on.
After sailing some time you will arrive between two
mountains; there the ship will turn to stone and you
will be greatly terrified. The girl will urge you to fetch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
some water of life, and you must then burn the dove&rsquo;s
feather, and the bird will immediately appear. You
will give him a little bottle that he may bring you some
water of life, and when he does so the ship will sail on
again, and you will come happily home with the king&rsquo;s
daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man listened to the advice of the maiden,
and then returned home and told all to his mother.
After that he went to the king and demanded all the
things that the maiden had counselled him to procure.
The king could not refuse, so all that he asked was given
him, and he sailed away.</p>

<p>All things happened exactly as the young maiden
had foretold, and the young man came back with the
king&rsquo;s daughter happily to his own country.</p>

<p>The king and his first minister, the uncle of the young
man, saw, from the windows of the palace, the ship
whilst yet it was far from the city; and the minister
said to the king, &lsquo;Now there is nothing left to do but
to kill him as he comes out of the ship!&rsquo; When the
ship reached the port, the king&rsquo;s daughter first came
ashore with her companions; then the handsome young
shopmen, and, lastly, the young man alone. But the
king had had the headsman placed there, and when the
young man stepped on the shore the executioner cut his
head off. The king intended to marry the king&rsquo;s
daughter; accordingly, as soon as she came on land he
ran to her, and began to caress her, but she turned away
her head from him, and said, &lsquo;Where is he who has been
working for me?&rsquo; And when she saw that his head was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
cut off she rushed to the body, took out some water of
life and poured over it, so he arose alive and well as
ever. When the king and his minister saw this wonder,
the minister said to the king, &lsquo;This man will know now
more than ever he did, since he has been dead and is
come back to life!&rsquo; Then the king began to wonder if
it were true that a man who has been dead knows more
when he returns to life, and, in order to satisfy his
curiosity, he ordered the headsman to cut off his head,
and directed that the girl with the water of life should
bring him again to life. But, after the king&rsquo;s head was
cut off, the girl refused to restore him to life. Instead
of doing so, she wrote a letter to her father, told him
all that had happened, and told him her wish to marry
the young man. So the king, her father, sent forth a
proclamation that the people should take the young man
for their king, and threatened to declare war against
them if they refused to do so. The people recognised
immediately the merits of the young man, and owned
that he deserved to be their king, and to marry the
king&rsquo;s daughter. Accordingly they made him king,
and he married the king&rsquo;s daughter. Then the handsome
young men, who had sailed with him in the ship
as shopmen, married the companions of the king&rsquo;s
daughter who was now queen, and thus all of them
became great dignitaries in the kingdom.</p>

<h2><a name="chap08" id="chap08"></a>WHO ASKS LITTLE, GETS MUCH.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE on a time there lived three brothers, who had
no property except one pear-tree. This they
watched carefully, each of them in turn guarding it,
whilst the other two worked for wages away from home.
One day God sent an angel to see how these brothers
were living; and ordered the angel, if they lived very
poorly, to give them better food. When the angel came
down to the earth, he changed himself into the form of
a beggar; and when he saw one of the brothers watching
the pear-tree, asked him to give him a pear. Then the
brother plucked some pears, and gave them to the
beggar, and said, &lsquo;Here, take these from my share of the
pears; I cannot give you any of those which belong to
my brothers.&rsquo; So the angel thanked the man and went
away.</p>

<p>Next morning the second brother remained to guard
the pear-tree; and the angel came again, and begged
him to give him a pear. The man took some of the
pears and gave them to the angel, saying, &lsquo;Take these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
from my pears; but from the pears of my brothers I
dare not give you any.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The third day the third brother stayed at home to
watch the pear-tree, and the angel came as before, and
asked only for one pear. And this brother said also,
&lsquo;Here are some of my pears; from the pears of my
brothers I cannot give you any.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The day after, the angel changed himself into a
monk, and came very early, so that he found all three
brothers at home, and said to them, &lsquo;Come with me; I
will give you better nourishment than you have at
present.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The three brothers followed him without saying a
word. At last they came to a large torrent, where the
water flowed in great streams, and made a loud noise.
Then the angel asked the eldest brother, &lsquo;What would
you like?&rsquo; And the man answered, &lsquo;I should like all
this water to be changed into wine, and to belong to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the angel made the sign of the cross in the air
with his stick, and, in a moment, wine was flowing instead
of water. On the banks of the river heaps of barrels
were being made, and men were working very diligently&mdash;in
short, there was quite a village. The angel then
left the eldest brother there, saying, &lsquo;Here is all you
wished! now keep yourself!&rsquo; and he continued his
journey with the other two brothers. Then they came
to a field covered over with a multitude of doves, and
the angel asked the second brother, &lsquo;What would you
like?&rsquo; &lsquo;I should like all these doves to be sheep, and to
belong to me!&rsquo; replied the man. The angel again made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
the sign of the cross in the air with his stick, and,
instantly, sheep were there instead of doves. There
were dairies also, and women milking the sheep; some
were pouring out the milk, and others collecting the
cream; some were making cheese, others churning
butter. There was also a slaughter-house, with men
cutting the meat into joints, whilst others were weighing
it, and others receiving money as they sold the meat.</p>

<p>Then the angel said to the second brother, &lsquo;Here is
what you wished for; now live.&rsquo; The angel now took
with him the youngest brother, walked with him across
the field, and then asked, &lsquo;And what would <em>you</em> like?&rsquo;
The man answered, &lsquo;I wish for nothing, except that
God may give me a wife of pure Christian blood!&rsquo;
Then the angel said, &lsquo;Oh, that is difficult to find! In
the whole world there are but three such, and two of
them are already married. The third is a maid still,
but she is asked in marriage by two wooers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the angel and the young man set out, and, having
journeyed a long way, at length came to the city where
the king dwelt whose daughter was of pure Christian
blood.</p>

<p>As soon as they arrived, they went to the palace to
ask for the girl. When they entered the palace, they
found two kings already there, and their wedding gifts
laid out upon a table. Then they also placed there the
presents they had brought. When the king saw them,
he said to all those who were standing before him,
&lsquo;What shall we do now? Those are the presents of
kings, but these look, in comparison, like the gifts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
a beggar!&rsquo; Then the angel said, &lsquo;I will tell you what
to do. Let the matter be decided in this way&mdash;the maid
shall take three vines, and plant them in the garden,
dedicating each of them to one of the three wooers. The
man on whose vine grapes are found next day is the one
the girl ought to marry.&rsquo; So all agreed to this, and the
maid planted three vines in the garden, dedicating each
of them to one of her three wooers.</p>

<p>The next morning, when they looked, grapes were
found on the vine dedicated to the poor man. So the
king could not help himself, and was obliged to give
his daughter to the youngest brother, and let them at
once be married in the church. After the wedding, the
angel took them to a forest, and left them there, where
they lived for a whole year.</p>

<p>At the end of a year, God again sent the angel,
saying, &lsquo;Go down and see how those poor men are
living. If their food be scanty, give them better
nourishment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The angel came down to earth as before, in the likeness
of a beggar, and went first to the brother who had
the torrent overflowing with wine. The beggar asked
for a cup of wine, but the man refused, saying, &lsquo;If I
were to give every one who asks a cup of wine, I should
have none for myself!&rsquo; When the angel heard this,
he made the sign of the cross with his stick, and the
torrent began to flow with water as at first. Then the
angel said to the eldest brother, &lsquo;That was not for thee!
go back under the pear-tree and guard it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>After that the angel went to the second brother who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
had the field quite covered with sheep, and begged him
to give him a morsel of cheese; but he refused, saying,
&lsquo;If I were to give every one a little bit of cheese, I
should have none left!&rsquo; When the angel heard this, he
made the sign of the cross in the air, and the sheep
turned in an instant into doves, and flew away.</p>

<p>Then the angel said to the second brother, &lsquo;That was
not for thee! go back under the pear-tree and guard it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>At last the angel went to see how the youngest brother
was living, and found him with his wife in the forest,
dwelling in a little hut, and living poorly. He begged
to be allowed to sleep there that night, and they received
him with great willingness, only excusing themselves
that they could not serve him as they would.
&lsquo;We are only poor people,&rsquo; they said. The angel answered,
&lsquo;Do not speak about that! I shall be quite
content with what you have for yourselves.&rsquo; Then these
poor people asked themselves what they must do. They
had no corn to make real bread; for they usually ground
the bark of certain trees, and made bread from it. Such
bread, therefore, the wife made now for their guest, and
put it to the fire to bake. Whilst it baked, they talked
with him. In a little while, when they looked to see
whether the cake was baked, they found that there
was a loaf of real bread quite ready for the table, and
very large. When they saw that, they lifted up their
hands and thanked God, saying, &lsquo;Thank thee, O God!
that we are now able to give food to our guest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they placed the bread before the angel, and also
filled a vessel with water, and when they came to drink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
they found it was wine. Then the angel made a sign
of the cross with his staff over the hut, and on that spot
rose a royal palace, filled with abundance of everything.
And the angel blessed the youngest brother and his
wife, and left them, and they lived there long and
very happily.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09" id="chap09"></a>JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE? WHICH IS BEST.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> KING had two sons; of these, one was cunning
and unjust, the other, just and gentle. After
the death of the father the elder son said to the younger,
&lsquo;Depart; I will not live with you any longer. Here are
three hundred zechins and a horse; this is your portion
of our father&rsquo;s property. Take it, for I owe you nothing
more than this.&rsquo; The younger son took the money and
the horse which were offered him, and said, &lsquo;Thank
God! See only how much of the kingdom has fallen
to me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the two brothers, both of whom
were riding, met by chance in a road. The younger
brother greeted the elder one, saying, &lsquo;God help thee,
brother!&rsquo; and the elder answered, &lsquo;Why do you speak
always about God? Nowadays, injustice is better than
justice.&rsquo; The younger brother, however, said to him,
&lsquo;I will wager with you that injustice is not, as you say,
better than justice.&rsquo; So they betted one hundred golden
zechins, and it was arranged that they should leave the
decision to the first man they met in the road. Riding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
together a little farther they met with Satan, who had
disguised himself as a monk, and they asked him to
decide which was better, justice or injustice? Satan
answered, &lsquo;Injustice!&rsquo; And the good brother paid the
bad one the hundred golden zechins which he had
wagered.</p>

<p>Then they betted for another hundred zechins, and
again a third time for a third hundred, and each time
Satan&mdash;who managed to disguise himself in different
ways and meet them&mdash;decided that injustice was better
than justice.</p>

<p>Thus the younger brother lost all his money, and his
horse into the bargain. Then he said, &lsquo;Thank God!
I have no more money, but I have eyes, and I wager
my eyes that justice is better than injustice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the unjust brother, without waiting for
any one&rsquo;s decision, drew his knife and cut both his
brother&rsquo;s eyes out, saying, &lsquo;Now you have no eyes, let
justice help you.&rsquo; But the younger brother in his
trouble only thanked God and said, &lsquo;I have lost my
eyes for the sake of God&rsquo;s justice, but I pray you, my
brother, give me a little water in some vessel to wash
my wounds and wet my mouth, and bring me away from
this place to the pine-tree just about the spring,
before you leave me.&rsquo; The unjust brother did so, gave
him water, and left him alone under the pine-tree near
the spring of water.</p>

<p>There the unfortunate remained, sitting on the
ground. Late, however, in the night, some fairies came
to the spring to bathe, and one of them said to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
others, &lsquo;Do you know, my sisters, that the king&rsquo;s
daughter has got the leprosy? The king has summoned
all the physicians, but no one can possibly help
her. But if the king only knew, he would take a little
of this water in which we are bathing, and wash his
daughter therewith! and then in a day and a night she
would recover completely from her leprosy. Just as
any one deaf, or dumb, or blind, could be cured by this
same water.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then, as the cocks began to crow, the fairies hurried
away. As soon as they were gone, the unfortunate man
felt his way slowly with his outstretched hands till
he came to the spring of water. There he bathed
his eyes, and in an instant recovered his sight.
After that he filled the vessel with water, and hurried
away to the king, whose daughter was leprous, and said
to the servants, &lsquo;I am come to cure the king&rsquo;s
daughter, if he will only let me try. I guarantee that
she will become healthy in a day and night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the king heard that, he ordered him to be led
into the room where the girl was, and made her immediately
bathe in the water. After a day and a night the
the girl came out pure and healthy.</p>

<p>Then the king was greatly pleased, and gave the
young prince the half of his kingdom, and also his
daughter for a wife, so that he became the king&rsquo;s son-in-law,
and the first man after him in the kingdom.</p>

<p>The tidings of this great event spread all over the
world, and so came to the ears of the unjust brother.
He guessed directly that his blind brother must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
met with good fortune under the pine-tree, so he went
himself to try to find it also. He carried with him a
vessel full of water, and then carved out his own eyes
with his knife. When it was dark the fairies came
again, and, as they bathed, spoke about the recovery of
the king&rsquo;s daughter. &lsquo;It cannot be otherwise,&rsquo; they
said, &lsquo;someone must have been listening to our last conversation
here. Perhaps someone is listening now. Let
us see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they searched all around, and when they came to
the pine-tree they found there the unjust brother who
had come to seek after good fortune, and who declared
always that injustice was better than justice. They
immediately caught him, and tore him into four parts.</p>

<p>And so, at the last, his wickedness did not help him,
and he found to his cost that justice is better than injustice.</p>

<h2><a name="chap10" id="chap10"></a>SATAN&rsquo;S JUGGLINGS AND GOD&rsquo;S MIGHT.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE morning the son of the king went out to hunt.
Whilst walking through the snow he cut himself a
little, and the drops of blood fell on the snow. When
he saw how pretty the red blood looked on the white
snow, he thought, &lsquo;Oh, if I could only marry a girl as
white as snow and as rosy red as this blood!&rsquo; Whilst he
was thus thinking, he met an old woman and asked her
if there were such maidens anywhere to be found. The
old woman told him that on the mountain he saw
before him he would find a house without doors, and the
only entrance and outlet of this house was a single window.
And she added, &lsquo;In that house, my son, there is
living a girl such as you desire; but of the young men
who have gone to ask her to be their wife none have returned.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That may all be as you say,&rsquo; answered the prince, &lsquo;I
will go, nevertheless! Only tell me the way that I
must take to get to the house.&rsquo; When the old woman
heard this resolve, she was sorry for the young man,
and, taking a piece of bread from her pouch, she gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
it to him, saying, &lsquo;Take this bread and keep it safe as
the apple of your eye!&rsquo; The prince took the bread, and
continued his journey. Very soon afterwards he met
another old woman, and she asked him where he was
going. He told her he was going to demand the girl
who lived in the doorless house on the mountain. Then
the old woman tried to dissuade him, telling him just
the same things as the former one had done. He said,
however, &lsquo;That may be quite true, nevertheless I will
go, even if I never return.&rsquo; Then the old woman gave
to the prince a little nut, saying, &lsquo;Keep this nut always
by you; it may help you some time or other!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince took the nut and went on his way, till he
came to where an old woman was sitting by the roadside.
She asked him, &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; Then he told
her he was going to demand the girl who lived in the
house on the mountain before him. Upon this the old
woman wept, and prayed him to give up all thoughts of
the girl, and she gave him the very same warnings as
the other old women had done. All this however was
of no use, the prince was resolved to go on, so the old
woman gave him a walnut, saying, &lsquo;Take this walnut,
and keep it carefully until you want it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He wondered at these presents, and asked her to tell
him why the first old woman had given him a piece of
bread, the second a nut, and she herself now a walnut.
The old woman answered, &lsquo;The bread is to throw to the
beasts before the house, that they may not eat you;
and, when you find yourself in the greatest danger, ask
counsel, first from the nut, and then from the walnut.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
Then the king&rsquo;s son continued his wandering, till he
came at last to a thick forest, in the midst of which
he saw the house with only a single window. When he
came near it he was attacked by a multitude of beasts
of all kinds, and, following the advice of the old woman,
he threw the bit of bread towards them. Then the
beasts came and smelt at the bread one after the other,
and, upon doing so, each drew his tail between his legs
and lay down quietly.</p>

<p>The house had no door, and but one window, which
was very high above the ground, so high that do what
he could he was not able to reach it. Suddenly he saw
a woman letting down her golden hair; so he rushed and
caught hold of it, and she drew him up thereby into the
house. Then he saw that the woman was she for whose
sake he had come to this place. The prince and the
girl were equally pleased to see each other, and she
said, &lsquo;Thank God that my mother happened to be from
home! She is gone into the forest to gather the plants
by the aid of which she transforms into beasts all the
young men who venture here to ask me to be their
wife. Those are the beasts who would have killed you,
if God had not helped you. But let us fly away from
this place.&rsquo; So they fled away through the forest as
quickly as they could. As they happened to look back,
however, they saw that the girl&rsquo;s mother was pursuing
them, and they became frightened. The old woman was
already very near them before the prince remembered
his nut. He took it out quickly and asked, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s
sake! tell me what we must do now?&rsquo; The nut replied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
&lsquo;Open me!&rsquo; The prince opened it, and from the little
nut flowed out a large river, which stopped the way, so
that for a time the girl&rsquo;s mother could not pass. However,
she touched the waters with her staff, and they immediately
divided and left her a dry path, so that she
could run on quickly after the prince and the girl.</p>

<p>When the prince saw she would soon come up with
them, he took out the walnut and asked, &lsquo;Tell me, what
we must do now?&rsquo; And the walnut replied, &lsquo;Break
me!&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son broke the walnut, and a great
fire flamed out from it&mdash;so great a fire that the whole
forest barely escaped being consumed by it. But the
girl&rsquo;s mother spat on the fire, and it extinguished itself
in a moment. Then the king&rsquo;s son saw that these were
nothing but the jugglings of the devil, so he turned
eastward, made the sign of the cross, and called on the
mighty God to help him. Then it suddenly thundered
and lightened, and from heaven flashed a thunderbolt
which struck the mother of the girl, and she fell dead
upon the ground.</p>

<p>Thus at length the king&rsquo;s son arrived safely at home,
and when the girl had been made a Christian, he
married her.</p>

<h2><a name="chap11" id="chap11"></a>THE WISE GIRL.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time a poor man lived in a small and
mean cottage. He possessed nothing in the world
except a daughter who was very wise indeed. She
taught her father how to beg, and how to speak wisely.
One day the poor man went to the king to beg, and the
king asked him whence he came, and who had taught
him to speak so well.</p>

<p>He told the king where he lived, and that he had a
daughter who told him what to say.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And who taught your daughter all this wisdom?&rsquo;
demanded the king. The poor man answered, &lsquo;God and
our poverty have made her wise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king gave him thirty eggs and said, &lsquo;Take
these eggs to your daughter, and tell her that if she
bring forth chickens from the eggs, I will make her
rich presents; but if she fails, then I will have you
tortured.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor man went back to his cottage weeping, and
told all this to his daughter. The girl saw at once that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
the eggs which the king had sent had been boiled, but
she told her father to go to sleep quietly, and she would
take care for everything. The father did as she said,
and, whilst he slept, she took a pot, filled it with water
and beans, and boiled them.</p>

<p>Next morning she told her father to take a plough
and oxen, and go to plough in a wood near to which the
king would pass. &lsquo;When you see the king coming,&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;take a handful of beans, and begin to sow,
shouting, &ldquo;Go on, my oxen, and God grant that the
boiled beans may bear fruit!&rdquo; When the king asks
you, &ldquo;How can you expect boiled beans to grow?&rdquo;
answer him, &ldquo;Just as much as from boiled eggs to hatch
chickens!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor man listened to his daughter, and went to
plough. When the king came near, he began to shout,
&lsquo;Ho ho, my oxen! go on! and God grant that these
boiled beans may bring me a good crop!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king, hearing these words, stopped his carriage,
and said to the poor man, &lsquo;Poor fellow, how can boiled
beans bear a crop?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just as well as boiled eggs can bring forth chickens,&rsquo;
answered the man.</p>

<p>The king saw that his daughter had taught him what
to say, and he ordered his servants to bring the man
before him. Then the king gave him a bunch of flax,
saying, &lsquo;Take this, and make from it all the sails a ship
needs. If you do not, you shall lose your life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor man took the bunch of flax with great
fear, and returned weeping to the cottage to tell his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
daughter, who bade him go to sleep quietly. Next
morning she gave him a small piece of wood, and told
him to take it to the king and demand that, from this
piece of wood, all the tools needful for spinning and
weaving should be made. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; continued she, &lsquo;I
will make all that he has ordered me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king was surprised, and considered a moment
what to do. At last he said, &lsquo;Take this little glass to
your daughter, and tell her she must empty the sea
with it, so that dry land shall be where the water now
is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor man took the little cup to his daughter, and,
weeping, told her all the king required. The girl bade
him be quiet till morning, and then she would do all
that was needed. Next morning she called her father,
gave him a pound of tow, and said, &lsquo;Take this to the
king, and tell him that with this tow he must first stop
all the sources of the rivers and lakes, and then I will
dry up the sea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the poor man went to the king and told him what
his daughter had said.</p>

<p>The king, seeing that the girl was wiser than himself,
ordered that she should be brought before him. When
she bent before the king, he said, &lsquo;Guess, maiden! what
can be heard at the greatest distance?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The girl answered, &lsquo;Your majesty, the thunder and
the lie can be heard at the greatest distance.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king grasped his beard, and, turning to his
courtiers, put to them the question, &lsquo;Guess what my
beard is worth?&rsquo; Some of them said so much, others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
again so much; but the girl observed to the king that
none of the courtiers had guessed right, and said, &lsquo;The
king&rsquo;s beard is worth as much as three summer rains.&rsquo;
The king, greatly astonished, said, &lsquo;It is so; the girl
has guessed rightly!&rsquo; Then he asked her if she were
willing to be his wife; and added that, if she were willing,
he would marry her.</p>

<p>The girl bent low and said, &lsquo;Let it be as your majesty
commands! But I pray you write with your hand on a
scrap of paper this promise, that if you should ever be
displeased with me, and should send me away from you,
I shall be allowed to take with me from the palace any
one thing which I like best.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king consented, and gave the promise.</p>

<p>After they had lived happily together for some time,
one day the king was angry, and said to his wife, &lsquo;I
will not have you any longer for my wife, and I bid you
leave the palace!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The queen answered, &lsquo;I will obey your majesty, but
permit me to pass one night more in the palace. To-morrow
I will go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This, the king could not well refuse.</p>

<p>That evening, at supper, the queen mixed something
with the wine, and offered it to the king to drink, saying,
&lsquo;Be of good cheer, O king! To-morrow we shall
separate and, believe me, I shall be happier than I was
when I first met you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king drank, and soon after fell asleep. Then
the queen ordered her carriage, and carried the king
away with her to the cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
Next morning, when the king awoke in the cottage
and saw where he was, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Who brought
me here?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The queen answered, &lsquo;I brought you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king asked, &lsquo;How have you dared to do so?
Did I not tell you I will not have you any longer for
my wife?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the queen took out the king&rsquo;s written promise,
and said, &lsquo;Yes, indeed, you told me so; but see,
you have written and promised that I &ldquo;shall be allowed
to take with me from the palace that which I like best,
whenever I must leave the court.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king, seeing the paper, kissed his wife, and
returned with her to the palace.</p>

<h2><a name="chap12" id="chap12"></a>GOOD DEEDS ARE NEVER LOST.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N days gone by there lived a married couple who
had one only son. When he grew up they made
him learn something which would be of use to him in
after-life. He was a kind, quiet boy, and feared God
greatly. After his schooling was finished his father
gave him a ship, freighted with various sorts of merchandise,
so that he might go and trade about the world,
and grow rich, and become a help to his parents in their
old age. The son put to sea, and one day the ship he
was in met with a Turkish vessel in which he heard
great weeping and wailing. So he demanded of the
Turkish sailors, &lsquo;Pray, tell me why there is so much
wailing on board your ship?&rsquo; and they answered, &lsquo;We
are carrying slaves which we have captured in different
countries, and those who are chained are weeping.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he said, &lsquo;Please, brothers, ask your captain if
he would give me the slaves for ready cash?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The captain gladly agreed to the proposal, and after
much bargaining the young man gave to the captain
his vessel full of merchandise, and received in exchange
the ship full of slaves.</p>

<p>Then he called the slaves before him, and demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
of each whence he came, and told them all they were
free to return to their own countries. At last he came
to an old woman who held close to her side a very
beautiful girl, and he asked them from what country
they came. The old woman told him, weeping, that
they came from a very distant land, saying, &lsquo;This young
girl is the only daughter of the king, and I am her
nurse, and have taken care of her from her childhood.
One day, unhappily, she went to walk in a garden far
away from the palace, and these wicked Turks saw her
and caught her. Luckily I happened to be near, and,
hearing her scream, ran to her help, and so the Turks
caught me too, and brought us both on board of this
ship.&rsquo; Then the old woman and the beautiful girl,
being so far from their own country, and having no
means of getting there, begged him that he would take
them with him. So he married the girl, took her with
him, and returned home.</p>

<p>When he arrived his father asked him about his ship
and merchandise, and he told him what had happened,
how he had given his vessel with its cargo, and had
bought the slaves and set them free. &lsquo;This girl,&rsquo; continued
he, &lsquo;is a king&rsquo;s daughter, and the old woman her
nurse; as they could not get back to their country, they
prayed to remain with me, so I married the girl.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the father was very angry, and said, &lsquo;My
foolish son! what have you done? Why have you
made away with my property without cause and of your
own will?&rsquo; and he drove him out of the house.</p>

<p>Then the son lived with his wife and her old nurse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
a long time in the same village, trying always, through
the good offices of his mother and other friends, to
obtain his father&rsquo;s forgiveness, and, begging him to let
him have a second ship full of merchandise, promised
to be wiser in future. After some time the father took
pity on him, and received him again into his house,
with his wife and her old nurse. Shortly after he fitted
him out another ship, larger than the first one, and
filled with more valuable merchandise. In this he sailed,
leaving his wife and her nurse in the house of his parents.
He came one day to a city where he found the soldiers
very busy carrying some unlucky villagers away to
prison. So he asked them, &lsquo;Why are you doing this
my brethren? Why are you driving these poor people
to prison?&rsquo; and the soldiers answered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;They have not paid the king&rsquo;s taxes, that is why we
take them to prison.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he went to the magistrate and asked, &lsquo;Please
tell me how much these poor prisoners owe?&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the magistrate told him he sold his goods and
ship, and paid the debts of all the prisoners,
and returned home without anything. Falling at
the feet of his father, he told him what he
had done, and begged him to forgive him. But
the father was exceedingly angry, more so than
before, and drove him away from his presence. What
could the unhappy son do in this great strait? How
could he go begging, he whose parents were so rich? After
some time his friends again prevailed upon the father
to receive him back, because, as they urged, so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
suffering had made him wiser. At last the father
yielded, took him again into his house, and prepared a
ship for him finer and richer than the two former ones.
Then the son had the portrait of his wife painted on
the helm, and that of the old nurse on the stern, and,
after taking leave of his father and mother, and wife,
he sailed away the third time.</p>

<p>After sailing for some days he came near a large city,
in which there lived a king, and, dropping anchor, he
fired a salute to the city. All the citizens wondered, as
did also their king, and no one could say who the
captain of the strange ship might be. In the afternoon
the king sent one of his ministers to ask who he was,
and why he came; and the minister brought a message
that the king himself would come at nine o&rsquo;clock the
next morning to see the ship. When the minister came
he saw on the helm the portrait of the king&rsquo;s daughter,
and on the stern that of her old nurse, and in his surprise
and joy dared not believe his own eyes. For the
princess had been promised to him in marriage while
she was yet a child, and long before she was captured
by the Turks.</p>

<p>But the minister did not tell any one what he had
seen.</p>

<p>Next morning, at nine o&rsquo;clock, the king came with
his ministers on board the ship, and asked the captain
who he was, and whence he came?</p>

<p>Whilst walking about the vessel he saw there the
portrait of the girl on the helm and that of the old
woman on the stern, and recognised the features of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
own daughter and her old nurse who had been captured
by the Turks. But his joy was so great, he dared not
believe his eyes, so he invited the captain to come that
afternoon to his palace to relate his adventures, hoping
thus to find out if his hopes were well founded.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, in obedience to the king&rsquo;s wish, he
went to the palace, and the king at once began to inquire
why the figure of the girl was painted on the helm
and that of the old woman on the stern. The captain
guessed at once that this king must be his wife&rsquo;s father,
so he told him everything that had happened&mdash;how he
had met the Turkish ship filled with slaves, and had
ransomed them and set them free. &lsquo;This girl, alone,&rsquo;
he continued, &lsquo;with her old nurse, had nowhere to go, as
her country was so far off, so they asked to remain with
me, and I married the girl.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the king heard this he exclaimed, &lsquo;That girl is
my only child, and the accursed Turks took her and
her old nurse. You, since you are her husband, will be
the heir to my crown. But go&mdash;go at once to your
home and bring me your wife that I may see her&mdash;my
only daughter, before I die. Bring your father, your
mother, bring all your family. Let your property be
all sold in that country, and come all of you here. Your
father shall be my brother, and your mother my sister,
as you are my son and the heir to my crown. We will
all live together here in one palace.&rsquo; Then he called
the queen, and all his ministers, and told them all
about his daughter. And there was great rejoicing and
festivity in the whole court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
After this the king gave his son-in-law his own large
ship to bring back the princess and the whole family.
So the captain left his own ship there, but he asked the
king to send one of his ministers with him, &lsquo;Lest they
should not believe me,&rsquo; he said; and the king gave
him as a companion for his voyage the same minister
to whom he had formerly promised the princess in
marriage. They arrived safely in port, and the captain&rsquo;s
father was surprised to see his son return so soon, and
with such a splendid vessel.</p>

<p>Then he told all that had happened and his mother
and wife, and especially the old nurse, rejoiced greatly
when they heard the good news. As the king&rsquo;s minister
was there to witness the truth of this strange news, no
one could doubt it. So the father and mother consented
to sell all their property and go to live in the
king&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>But the minister resolved to kill this new heir to the
king and husband of the princess who had been
promised to him for wife; so, when they had sailed a
long distance, he called him on deck to confer with
him. The captain had a quiet conscience, and did not
suspect any evil, so he came up at once, and the minister
caught him quickly and threw him overboard.</p>

<p>The ship was sailing fast, and it was rather dark, so
the captain could not overtake her, but was left behind
in the deep waters. The minister, however, went
quietly to sleep.</p>

<p>Fortunately the waves carried the king&rsquo;s young heir
to a rock near the shore; it was, however, a desert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
country, and no one was near to help him. Those he
had left on board the ship, seeing next morning that he
had disappeared, began to weep and wail, thinking he
had fallen overboard in the night and been drowned.
His wife especially lamented him, because they had
loved each other very much. When the ship arrived at
the king&rsquo;s city, and reported to him the great disaster
that had befallen them, the king was troubled, and the
whole court mourned greatly. The king kept the
parents and family of the young man by him as he had
engaged to do, but they could not console themselves for
their great loss.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the king&rsquo;s unhappy son-in-law sat on the
rock, and lived on the moss which grew there, and was
scorched by the hot sun, from which he had no shelter;
his garments were soiled and torn, and no one would
have recognised him. Still not a living soul was to be
seen anywhere to help him. At last, after fifteen days
and fifteen nights, he noticed an old man on the shore,
leaning on a staff, and engaged in fishing. Then the
king&rsquo;s heir shouted to the old man, and begged him to
help him off the rock. The old fisherman consented&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you will pay me for it,&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can I pay you when, as you see, I have nothing,
and even my clothes are only rags?&rsquo; answered the young
man sadly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, that matters nothing,&rsquo; exclaimed the old man;
&lsquo;I have here pen and paper, so, if you know how to
use them, write a promise to give me half of everything
you may ever possess, and then sign the paper.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
To that the young man gladly consented; so the old
man walked through the water to him, and he signed
the paper, and then the old man took him over to the
shore. After that he journeyed from village to village,
barefoot, hungry, and sorrowful, and begged some garments
to cover him.</p>

<p>After thirty days&rsquo; wandering, his good luck led him
to the city of the king, and he went and sat at the door
of the palace, wearing on his finger his wedding-ring,
on which was his own name and the name of his wife.
At eventide, the king&rsquo;s servants took him into the
courtyard, and gave him to eat what remained of their
supper. Next morning he took his stand by the garden-door,
but the gardener came and drove him away, saying
that the king and his family were soon coming that
way. So he moved away a little, and sat down near a
corner of the garden and shortly afterward he saw the
king walking with his mother, his father leading the
queen, and his wife walking with the minister, his great
enemy. He did not yet desire to show himself to them,
but as they passed near him and gave him alms, his
wife saw the wedding-ring on a finger of the hand which
he held out to take the money. Still she could not think
the beggar could be her husband, so she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me see the ring you have on your finger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The minister, who was walking by her, was a little
frightened, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go on, how can you speak to that ragged beggar?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But she would not hear him. She took the ring, and
read thereon her own and her husband&rsquo;s names. Her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>101]</a></span>
heart was greatly troubled by the sight of the ring, but
she controlled her feelings and said nothing. As soon
as they returned to the palace, she told the king, her
father, that she had recognised her husband&rsquo;s ring on
the hand of the beggar who sat by the side of the
garden. &lsquo;So please send for him,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that we
may find out how the ring came into his hands.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king sent his servants to find the beggar,
and they brought him to the palace. And the king
asked him whence he came, and how he got that ring.
Then he could no longer restrain himself, but told them
how he had been thrown overboard by the treacherous
minister, and spent fifteen days and nights on the naked
rock, and how he had been saved.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You see now how God and my right-dealing have
brought me back to my parents and my wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When they heard that, they could hardly speak, so
rejoiced were they. Then the king summoned the father
and mother, and related what had happened to their
son.</p>

<p>The servants quickly brought him fine new garments,
and bathed and clothed him. Then for many days
there was great rejoicings, not only in the palace, but
also in all the city, and he was crowned as king. The
minister was seized by the king&rsquo;s order, and given up
to the king&rsquo;s son-in-law, that he might punish him
after his own will. But the young king would not permit
him to be put to death, but forgave him, on condition
that he left the kingdom instantly.</p>

<p>A few days after, the old man who had saved the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
young king came, bringing with him his written promise.
The young king took the paper, and reading it,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My old man, sit down. To-day I am king, but if I
were a beggar I would fulfil my word, and acknowledge
my signature. Therefore we will divide all that I have.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he took out the book and began to divide the
cities.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is for me&mdash;that is for you.&rsquo; So saying, he
wrote all on a chart, till all were divided between them,
from the greatest city to the poorest barrack.</p>

<p>The old man accepted his half, but immediately made
a present of it again to the young king, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take it! I am not an old man, but an angel from
God! I was sent by God to save thee, for the sake of
thy good deeds. Now reign and be happy, and may thy
prosperity last long.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The angel disappeared; and the king reigned there in
great happiness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;God bless you too, my son,&rsquo; replied the man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can I grind my corn here?&rsquo; asked the boy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; responded Beardless; &lsquo;my corn will be
soon ready, and you can grind yours as long as you
like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the boy recollected his father&rsquo;s advice, and left
the mill and went to another. But Beardless took
some corn, and hurried by a shorter way, to the mill
towards which the boy had gone, and reached there
before him, and put some of his corn into the mill to
be ground. When the boy arrived, he was greatly
surprised to find Beardless there, and so he went away
from this and approached a third mill. But Beardless
hurried by a short cut, and reached this mill also before
the boy, and gave some of his corn to be ground. He
did the same at a fourth mill; so the boy got tired, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
thinking that he should find Beardless in every mill,
put down his sack, and resolved to grind in this mill,
although Beardless was there.</p>

<p>When the boy&rsquo;s corn came to be ground, Beardless
said to him, &lsquo;Hearken, my son. Let us make a cake of
your flour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy was thinking all the time of his father&rsquo;s
words, but he could not help himself. So he said,
&lsquo;Very good, we will make one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Beardless got up and began to mix the flour with
water, which the boy brought him, and he kept mixing
till all the corn was ground, and all the flour made into
a very large loaf. Then they made a fire, put the bread
to bake, and, when it was baked, took it and placed it
against a wall.</p>

<p>Then Beardless said, &lsquo;My son, listen to me. If we
were to divide the loaf between us, it would not be
enough for either of us, so let us tell each other some
lies, and whoever tells the greatest lie shall have the
whole loaf for himself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy thought, &lsquo;I cannot now draw back, so I may
as well do my best and go on.&rsquo; So he said aloud to
Beardless, &lsquo;Very well, but you must begin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Beardless told many different lies, and when he
got quite tired of lying, the boy said to him, &lsquo;Eh! my
dear Beardless, if that is all you know, it is not much.
Only listen, and have patience a little, whilst I tell you
a real truth. In my <em>young</em> days, when I was an <em>old</em>
man, we had very many beehives, and it was my business
every morning to count them. Now I always counted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
the bees easily enough, but I never could count the beehives.
One morning, whilst counting the bees, I saw
that the best bee was missing, so I put a saddle on the
cock and mounted, and started in search of my bee.
I traced it to the sea-shore, and saw that it had gone
over the sea, so I followed it. When I got over, I saw
that a man had caught my bee, and was ploughing a
field with it in which he was about to sow millet. I
called to him, &ldquo;That is my bee! How did you get
her?&rdquo; And the man said, &ldquo;Well, brother, if it is
yours, take it.&rdquo; And he gave me back my bee, and also
a sack full of millet. Then I put the sack on my back,
and moved the saddle from the cock to the bee. Then I
mounted it, and led the cock behind me, that he might
rest a little. Whilst I was crossing the sea, somehow
one of the strings of the sack broke, and all the millet
fell into the water.</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I had got over it was already night, so I
dismounted and let the bee loose to graze. The cock
I fastened near me, and gave him some hay; after that
I lay down to sleep. When I awoke in the morning, I
found the wolves had killed my bee and eaten it up; and
the honey was lying all about the valley ankle-deep;
and on the hills it lay knee-deep. Then I began to
think in what I could gather up all the honey. I remembered
I had a little axe by me, so I went into the
forest to try to kill some beast, in order to make a sack
from its skin. In the forest I saw two deer dancing
on one leg; so I broke the leg with my little axe and
caught them both. From the two deer I drew three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
skins and made three bags, wherein I gathered up all the
honey. I put the sacks full of honey on the cock&rsquo;s back,
and hastened home. When I reached home I found
that my father had just been born, and they sent me to
heaven to bring some holy water. Whilst I was thinking
how I should go up to heaven, I remembered the
millet which had fallen into the sea. When I reached
the sea I found the millet had grown up quite to
heaven, so I climbed it and reached the sky. And on
getting into heaven I saw the millet was quite ripe, and
that one whom I met there had reaped it, and had
already made a loaf from it, and had broken some pieces
into warm milk, which he was eating. I greeted him,
saying, &ldquo;God help you!&rdquo; and he answered, &ldquo;God help
thee also!&rdquo; and then he gave me holy water and I returned.
But I found that meanwhile there had been
a great rain, so that the sea had risen and carried away
my millet. Then I grew very anxious as to how I
should get down again to earth. At last I remembered
that I have long hair, so long that when I stand upright
it reaches down to the ground, and when I sit it
reaches to my ears; so I took my knife and cut one hair
after another, and tied them together as I went down
them. Meanwhile it grew dark, so I tied a knot in the
hair, and resolved to rest on that knot through the
night. But how should I do without a fire? The
tinder-box I had by me, but I had no wood! Then I
remembered I had somewhere in my overcoat a sewing-needle,
so I found it, cut it in pieces and made a great
fire, and when I was well warmed laid myself down near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
the fire to sleep. I slept soundly, but, unfortunately, a
spark of fire burnt the hair through, and so head over
heels I fell to the ground, and sank into the earth up to
my girdle. I looked about to see how I could get out,
and, seeing no help near, I hurried home for a spade and
came back and dug myself out. Then I took the holy
water to my father. When I arrived at home I found
the reapers working in the corn-field. The corn
was so high, that the reapers were almost burnt up.
Then I shouted to them, &ldquo;Why do you not bring our
mare here which is two days&rsquo; long and a day and a half
broad, and on whose back large trees are growing?
Bring her that she may make a little shadow on the
field!&rdquo; My father quickly brought the mare, and the
reapers worked on quite pleasantly in her shadow. Then
I took a vessel to bring some water. But the water was
frozen, so I took my head and broke the ice with it.
Then I filled the vessel with water, and carried it to the
reapers. When they saw me they all shouted, &ldquo;But
where is your head?&rdquo; I put up my hand to feel for my
head, and found, alas, that I had no head on my
shoulders. I had forgotten it, and had left it by the
water. So I returned quickly, but a fox had got there
before me, and was drawing the brains from my head to
eat. Then I approached slowly and struck the fox
furiously, and he began to run, and, in running, dropped
a little book from his pocket. I opened the book, and
there I read, &ldquo;The whole loaf is for me, and Beardless is
to get nothing!&rdquo;&rsquo; So the boy caught up the loaf and
ran off home, and Beardless remained looking after him.</p>

<h2><a name="chap14" id="chap14"></a>THE WICKED STEPMOTHER.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once on a time a stepmother who hated
her step-daughter exceedingly, because she was
more beautiful than her own daughter whom she had
brought with her into the house. By-and-by, the father
learned also to hate his own child: he scolded her, and
beat her, in order to please his wife. One day his wife
said to him, &lsquo;Let us send your daughter away! Let
her look out for herself in the world!&rsquo; Upon this
the man asked, &lsquo;Where can we send her? Where
can the poor girl go alone?&rsquo; To this the wife answered,
&lsquo;If you will not do this, husband, I will no longer
live with you. You had better take her to-morrow out
of the house. You can lead her into the forest, and
then steal away from her and hurry home!&rsquo; She repeated
this so often that at length he consented, but
said, &lsquo;At least prepare the girl something for her
journey, that she may not die the first day of hunger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The stepmother thereupon made a cake, and, the
next morning early, the father led the girl far away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
into the very heart of the forest, and there left her and
went back home.</p>

<p>The poor girl, thus left alone, wandered all day about
the wood seeking for a path, but could find no way out
of it. When it grew dark she got up into a tree to
pass the night, fearing lest some wild beasts would eat
her if she remained on the ground. And, indeed, all
night long the wolves were howling under the tree, so
that the poor girl trembled so much that she could
hardly keep her herself from falling. When day
dawned she descended from the tree and walked on
again, hoping to find some way out of the forest. But
the wood grew thicker and thicker, and seemed to have
no end. In the evening whilst she was looking for a
tree in which she might remain safely over the night,
all at once she saw something shining in the forest.
So she went on, hoping to find some shelter, and at
length came to a fine large house. The gates were
open, so she went in, and walked through a great many
rooms, each one more beautiful than the other. On a
table in one room she found a candle burning. She
thought this must be the house of some robbers; but
she was not afraid, for she reasoned with herself, &lsquo;Rich
men have reason to fear robbers, but I have none&mdash;I
will tell them that I will serve them gladly for a piece
of bread.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She then took the cake from her bag, said grace, and
began to eat. Just as she had begun to eat a cock came
into the room, and sprung upon the table to reach the
cake, so the girl crumbled some of it for him. Then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
little dog came in and jumped quite friendly upon her,
so she broke a piece from her cake for the little dog, and
took him on her knee, and petted and fed him. After
that came in a cat also, and the girl fed her too.</p>

<p>At length the girl heard a loud noise as if some
great beast was coming, and was greatly frightened
when a lion came into the room. But the lion moved
his tail in such a friendly way, and looked so very
kindly, that she took heart, and offered him a piece of
her cake. The lion took it and began to lick her hand,
and the girl had no longer any fear of him, so she
stroked him gently and fed him with the rest of the
cake. Suddenly she heard a great noise of weapons,
and almost swooned as a creature in a bear-skin entered
the room. The cock, the dog, the cat, and the lion, all
ran to it, and jumped about it affectionately, showing in
all possible ways their great joy. The poor girl thought it
a very strange beast, and expected it would jump upon
her and kill her. But the fearful thing threw the bear-skin
from its head and shoulders, and all the room
shone and glittered with its golden garments. The
poor girl almost lost her senses when she saw before
her a handsome man, beautifully dressed. But he came
up to her and said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my dear! I am
not a bad man, I am the son of the king, and when I
wish to hunt I come here and use this bear-skin as a
disguise lest the people should recognise me. Those
who see me believe that I am a ghost and run away from
me. No one dares to come into this house, knowing
that I often come here. You are the only person who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
has ventured in. How did you know that I am not a
ghost?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then she told him she had never heard of him nor
of the house, but that her stepmother had driven her
away from home, and she told him all that had happened
to her. When he heard this, he was very sorry,
and said, &lsquo;Your stepmother hated you, but God has
been kind to you. I will marry you if you are willing
to be my wife&mdash;will you consent?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; she replied.
Next day he took her to his father&rsquo;s palace and married
her. After some time she begged to be allowed to go
to see her father. So her husband allowed her to go, and
she dressed herself all in gold and went to her father&rsquo;s
house. The father happened to be away from home,
and the stepmother, seeing her coming, was afraid lest
she had come to revenge herself. So she hurried to
meet her and said, &lsquo;You see that it was I who sent you
on the road to happiness.&rsquo; The step-daughter kissed
her, and embraced her step-sister. Then the girl said
she was very sorry that she had not found her father at
home, and, on her going away, she gave plenty of
money to her stepmother. When, however, she had
gone away the stepmother shook her fist after her and
cried, &lsquo;Wait a little, you shall not be the only one so
dressed out; to-morrow I will send my own daughter
after you the same way!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When her husband came home at night she told him
all that had happened, and said, &lsquo;What do you think,
husband? would it not be a good thing to send my girl
also into the wood to try her fortune; for your girl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
whom we sent there, never came back until now, and
now she has come glittering in gold?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The man sighed and agreed to the proposal. Next
day the stepmother prepared for her daughter plenty of
cakes and roasted meats, and then sent her with the
father into the forest. The man led her deep into the
forest, as he had done his own daughter, and there left
her. Finding the father did not return, she began to
seek a way to get home, and soon came in sight of the
house in the forest. She entered it, and seeing no one,
fastened the door inside, saying as she did so, &lsquo;If God
himself comes I will not open to Him.&rsquo; Then she took
out of her bag the baked meats and cakes and began to
eat. Whilst she was eating, the cock, the dog, and the
cat came in suddenly, and began to play about her
affectionately, hoping she would give them something;
but she became quite angry, and exclaimed, &lsquo;The devil
take you! I have hardly enough for myself: do you
think I will give any to you?&rsquo; Then she began to beat
them; whereat the dog howled, and the lion hearing it
rushed in furiously, caught the girl and killed her.</p>

<p>Next day the king&rsquo;s son came with his wife to hunt.
She immediately recognised her sister&rsquo;s dress, and
gathered together the fragments of the body, which she
took to her stepmother. She found her father at home
this time, and he was greatly pleased to hear that his
daughter was married to the king&rsquo;s son. When, however,
he heard what had happened with the daughter of
his wife, he was very sorry, but said, &lsquo;Her mother has
deserved this from the hand of God, because she hated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
you without a cause. There she is at the well, I will
go and tell her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the stepmother heard what had happened to
her daughter, she said to her husband, &lsquo;I cannot bear
your daughter! I cannot bear to look at her! Let us
kill her and her husband. If you will not consent, I
will jump down into this well!&rsquo; &lsquo;I cannot kill my
own child,&rsquo; returned he. &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; cried she, &lsquo;if
<em>you</em> will not kill her, <em>I</em> cannot endure her!&rsquo; and so she
jumped down into the well.</p>

<h2><a name="chap15" id="chap15"></a>BIRD GIRL.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time lived a king, who had only one
son; and when this son grew up, his father sent
him to travel about the world, in order that he might
find a maiden who would make him a suitable wife.</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s son started on his journey, and travelled
through the whole world without finding anywhere a
maiden whom he loved well enough to marry. Seeing
then that he had taken so much trouble, and had spent
so much time and money, and all to no purpose, he
resolved to kill himself. With this intention, he
climbed to the top of a high mountain, that he might
throw himself from its summit; for he wished that
even his bones might never be found. Having arrived
at the top of the mountain, he saw a sharp rock jutting
out from one side of it, and was climbing up to throw
himself from it, when he heard a voice behind him
calling, &lsquo;Stop! stop! O man! Stop for the sake of three
hundred and sixty-five which are in the year!&rsquo; He
looked back, and seeing no one, asked, &lsquo;Who are you
that speak to me? Let me see you? When you know
how miserable I am, you will not prevent me killing
myself!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
He had scarcely said these words when there appeared
to him an old man, with hair as white as wool, who
said, &lsquo;I know all about you. But listen! Do you see
that high hill?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo; said the prince. &lsquo;And
do you see the multitude of marble blocks which are
on it?&rsquo; said the old man. &lsquo;Yes, I do,&rsquo; rejoined the
prince. &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; continued the old man, &lsquo;on the
summit of that hill there is an old woman with golden
hair, who sits night and day on that very spot, and
holds a bird in her bosom. Whoever can get this bird
into his hands, will be the happiest man in the world.
But, be careful. If you are willing to try and get the
bird, you must take the old woman by her hair before
she sees you. If she sees you before you catch her by
her hair, you will be changed into a stone on the spot.
Thus it happened to all those young men you see standing
there, as if they were blocks of marble.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the king&rsquo;s son heard this, he thought, &lsquo;It is
all one to me whether I die here or there. If I succeed,
so much the better for me; if I fail, I can but die
as I had resolved.&rsquo; So he went up the hill. When
he arrived near the old woman, he walked very
cautiously towards her, hoping to reach her unseen;
for, luckily, the old woman was lying with her back
towards him, sunning herself, and playing with the bird.</p>

<p>When near enough, he sprang suddenly and caught
her by the hair. Then the old woman cried out, so
that the whole hill shook as with a great earthquake;
but the king&rsquo;s son held fast by her hair, and when
she found that she could not escape she said, &lsquo;What do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
you desire from me?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;That you should
give me the bird in your bosom, and that you call back
to life all these Christian souls!&rsquo; The old woman consented,
and gave him the bird. Then from her
mouth she breathed a blue wind towards the men of
stone, and immediately they again became alive. The
king&rsquo;s son, having the bird in his hands, was so rejoiced,
that he began to kiss it; and, as he kissed it, the
bird was transformed into a most beautiful maiden.</p>

<p>This girl the enchantress had turned into a bird, in
order that she might allure the young men to her.
The girl pleased the king&rsquo;s son exceedingly, and he
took her with him, and prepared to return home. As
he was going down the hill, the girl gave him a stick,
and told him the stick would do everything that he
desired of it. So the king&rsquo;s son struck with it once upon
the rock, and in a moment there came out a mass of
golden coin, of which they took plenty for use on their
journey. As they were travelling they came to a great
river, and could find no place by which they could pass
over; so the king&rsquo;s son touched the surface of the river
with his stick, and the water divided, so that a dry path
lay before them, and they were able to cross over the
river dryshod. A little farther they came to a herd of
wolves, and the wolves attacked them, and seemed about
to tear them to pieces; but the prince struck at them
with his stick, and one by one the wolves were turned
into ants. Thus, at length, the king&rsquo;s son reached
home safely with his beloved, and they were shortly
after married, and lived long and happily together.</p>

<h2><a name="chap16" id="chap16"></a>SIR PEPPERCORN.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HREE brothers once upon a time went out into the
neighbouring forest to choose some trees fit for
building. Before going, however, they told their
mother not to forget to send their sister into the wood
after them with their dinners. The mother sent the
girl as she had been told to do; but as the girl was on
her way a giant met her in the wood, and carried her
off to a cave, where he lived.</p>

<p>All day long the brothers waited, expecting their
sister, and wondering why their mother had forgotten
to send them food. At length, after remaining two
days in the forest, and becoming anxious and angry at
the delay, they went home. When they arrived there
they asked their mother why she had not sent their
sister with their food, as she had promised to do; she
replied that she had sent the girl three days ago, and
had been wondering greatly why she had not come back.</p>

<p>When the three brothers heard this they were exceedingly
troubled, and the eldest said, &lsquo;I will go back
into the forest and look for my sister.&rsquo; Accordingly
he went. After wandering about some time he came
to a shepherdess, who was minding a flock of sheep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
He asked her anxiously if she had seen his sister in the
wood, or whether she could tell him anything about
her. The shepherdess replied that she had indeed seen
a girl carrying food, but a giant had met her and
carried her off to his cave. Then the young man asked
her to tell him the way to the giant&rsquo;s cave; which she
did. The cave was hidden in a deep ravine. The
brother at once went down, and called aloud on his
sister by name. In a short time the girl came to the
mouth of the cave, and, seeing her eldest brother,
invited him to come in. This he did, and was exceedingly
surprised to see that the seeming cave was in
reality a magnificent palace. Whilst he stood there,
talking to his sister, and inquiring how she liked her
new home, he heard a loud whirring in the air overhead,
and, immediately afterwards, saw a heavy mace
fall on the ground just in front of the cave. Greatly
terrified and astonished, he asked his sister what this
meant, and she told him not to be afraid, for it was only
the way the giant let her know of his return three hours
before he came, that she might begin to prepare his
supper.</p>

<p>When it grew dark the giant came home, and was at
once aware that a stranger was in his place. In reply
to his angry questions, his wife told him it was &lsquo;only
her brother, who had come to visit them.&rsquo; When the
giant heard this he went to the mouth of the cave, and
calling a shepherd, ordered him to kill the largest sheep
in his flock and roast it.</p>

<p>When the meat was ready the giant called his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
brother-in-law, and said, as he cut the sheep in two
equal parts, &lsquo;My dear brother-in-law, listen well to
what I say; if you eat your half of the meat sooner
than I eat mine, I will give you leave to kill me; but if
I eat my half quicker than you eat yours, I shall certainly
kill you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the poor brother-in-law began to shake
all over with fright; and, fearing the worst, tried to
eat as fast as he could. But he had hardly swallowed
three mouthfuls before the giant finished his share of
the sheep, and killed him, according to his threat.</p>

<p>For some time the other two brothers and their
old mother waited impatiently to see if the elder
brother would come back. At last, hearing nothing
either of the brother or of the sister, the second son
said, &lsquo;I will go and look after them.&rsquo; So he went into
the same forest where his brother had gone, and, meeting
there the same shepherdess minding her sheep, he
inquired if he had seen his brother or sister. The
shepherdess answered him as she had answered the
elder brother, and he, too, asked the way to the giant&rsquo;s
cave, and, on being told, went down the ravine until
he reached the place. There he called on his sister by
name, and she came out and invited him to enter the
cave. This he did, and shared the fate of his brother;
for, being unable to eat his part of the sheep as quickly
as the giant ate his, he was also killed.</p>

<p>Not long after, the third brother went forth the same
road, to look after his two elder brothers and sister, and,
having found the giant&rsquo;s cave, was likewise invited to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
eat half a sheep, or be put to death. He, however,
failed like his brothers had done before him, and
being unable to eat his part of the sheep as quickly
as the giant ate his, he was also killed.</p>

<p>Now the parents being alone in their house, prayed
that God would give them another son, even were he
no bigger than a peppercorn. As they prayed so it
came to pass, and not very long after a little boy was
born to them, who was so extremely small that they
christened him &lsquo;Peppercorn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the boy was old enough he went out to play
with other boys; and one day, in a quarrel, one of these
said to him, &lsquo;May you share the fate of your three
elder brothers!&rsquo; Hearing this, Peppercorn ran off
home at once, and asked his mother what these words
meant. So the mother was forced to tell him how his
three brothers had gone into the forest to look after
their lost sister, and had never come back again. As
soon as he heard this, Peppercorn began to search the
house for pieces of old iron, and, having found some
scraps, carried them off in the evening to a blacksmith,
that with them he might make him a mace. Next
morning, Peppercorn went to the smith to ask for his
mace, which the man gave him, saying at the same
time, &lsquo;Now, pay me for making it.&rsquo; To this, Peppercorn
replied, &lsquo;First, let me see if it is strong enough;&rsquo;
and he threw it up in the air and held his head so that
the mace might fall upon it. As soon as the mace
struck his head, it broke into pieces; and Peppercorn,
seeing how badly it was made, fell into a passion and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>121]</a></span>
killed the smith. Then he gathered up the pieces of
iron, and went off to look for a better workman. He
soon found another blacksmith who was willing to
make him a mace, but demanded a ducat for the work.
Peppercorn said he would willingly pay the ducat if the
smith made him a really strong serviceable mace.
So next morning he went to ask if it was
ready, and the smith said &lsquo;Yes; but you must
first pay me the ducat, and then I will give it you.&rsquo;
Peppercorn, however, answered, &lsquo;The ducat is ready in
my pocket, but I must first see if the mace is good
before I pay for it.&rsquo; Thereupon he caught it, flung it
up in the air, and held his head under it as it fell. As
soon as the mace struck his head it broke into pieces;
and he, again falling into a great passion, killed this
smith also.</p>

<p>Gathering up the pieces of iron, he now carried them
to a third smith, who undertook to make him a good
strong mace, and demanded a ducat for doing so. Next
morning Peppercorn went for the mace, and, after trying
it three times, each time throwing it up higher in
the air and letting it fall on his head, where it raised
great bumps, he owned that he was satisfied with it,
and accordingly paid the smith the ducat as he had
promised.</p>

<p>Having now a good strong mace, Peppercorn started
off at once for the forest, in which his three elder
brothers and his sister had been lost. After wandering
about for some time, he came to the place where the
shepherdess sat watching her sheep, and, in reply to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
questions, she told him that she had seen his three
brothers go down the ravine in search of their sister,
but had never seen them come up again.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, Peppercorn went resolutely
down the ravine, calling aloud upon his sister by name.
When she heard this she was exceedingly surprised,
and said to herself, &lsquo;Who can this be calling me by
name, now that all my brothers are killed? I have no
other relations to come and look for me!&rsquo; Then she
went to the entrance of the cave and called out, &lsquo;Who
is it that calls me; I have no longer any brothers?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Peppercorn said to her, &lsquo;I am your brother who was
born after you left home, and my name is Peppercorn!&rsquo;</p>

<p>On hearing this, his sister led him into the palace,
but he had hardly had time to say a few words to her
before a loud whirring was heard in the air, and
the giant&rsquo;s mace fell to the ground. For a moment
Peppercorn was terrified at this, but he recovered himself
quickly, and, pulling the mace out of the ground,
flung it back to the giant, who, in astonishment, said
to himself, &lsquo;Who is this who throws my mace back to
me? Methinks I have at last found someone able to
fight with me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the giant came home, he immediately asked
his wife who had been in the cave, and she answered
him, &lsquo;It is my youngest brother!&rsquo; Thereupon the
giant ordered the shepherd to bring the largest sheep
in his flock. When this was brought, the giant killed
it himself, and, whilst preparing it for roasting, said
to Peppercorn, &lsquo;Will you turn the meat, or will you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
take care of the fire?&rsquo; Peppercorn said he would rather
gather wood and make the fire; so he went out and
tumbled down some large trees with his mace. These
he carried to the mouth of the cave, and made a large
fire ready for the meat.</p>

<p>When the sheep was roasted, the giant cut it in
two parts, and gave one half to Peppercorn, saying,
&lsquo;Take this half, and if you eat it before I eat my half
you are free to kill me; but if you don&rsquo;t, I shall surely
kill you!&rsquo; So Peppercorn and the giant began to eat
as fast as they could, swallowing down large pieces of
meat, and, in their haste, almost choking themselves.
At last, Peppercorn, by trickery, managed to get rid
of his share of the sheep, and, according to the arrangement,
killed the giant. This done, with the help of his
sister, he collected all the treasures the giant had
heaped up in his palace, and, taking them with him,
returned home with his sister, to the great joy of their
parents.</p>

<p>Peppercorn remained some time after this with his
father, mother, and sister, and they lived very merrily
on the treasures he had brought from the giant&rsquo;s cave.
At length, however, he saw that the riches were coming
to an end, so he resolved to go into the world to seek his
fortune.</p>

<p>After travelling about a good while he came one day
to a large city where he saw a great crowd gathered
about a man who held an iron pike in his hand, and
every now and then squeezed drops of water out of the
iron. Whilst the people watched, wondering and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
admiring his great strength, Peppercorn went up and
asked him, &lsquo;Do you think there is any man in the
world stronger than yourself?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is only one man alive who is stronger than
myself, and that one is a certain person called Peppercorn,&rsquo;
answered he. &lsquo;Peppercorn can receive a mace
on his head without being hurt!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon Peppercorn told the man who he was, and
proposed to him that they should travel about the
world together.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That will I right gladly,&rsquo; said the Pikeman. &lsquo;How
can I help being glad to go with a trusty fellow like
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Travelling together they came one day to a certain
city, and, finding a concourse of people assembled, they
went to see what was the matter. They found a man
sitting on the bank of a river turning the wheels of
nine mills with his little finger. So they said to him,
&lsquo;Is there any one stronger than you in the world?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he answered them, &lsquo;There are only two men
stronger than I am&mdash;a certain person named Peppercorn
and a certain Pikeman.&rsquo; Hearing this, Peppercorn
and the Pikeman told him who they were, and
proposed that he should join them in their travels
about the world.</p>

<p>The Mill-turner very gladly accepted the offer, and
so all three continued their journey together.</p>

<p>After travelling some time they came to a city
where they found all the people greatly excited because
some one had stolen the three daughters of the king, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
notwithstanding the immense rewards his majesty had
offered, no one had as yet dared to go out to look for
the princesses. As soon as Peppercorn and his two
comrades heard this they went to the king and offered
to search for his three daughters. But in order to
accomplish the task they demanded that the king should
give them a hundred thousand loads of wood. The king
gave them what they wanted, and they made a fence
all around the city with the timber. This done they
began to watch.</p>

<p>The first morning they prepared a whole ox for their
dinners, and discussed the question which of the three
should stay behind to mind the meat whilst the other
two watched the fence. The Pikeman said, &lsquo;I think I
will stay here and take care of the meat, and I will
have dinner ready for you when you come back from
looking after the fence.&rsquo; So it was thus settled. Just,
however, as the Pikeman thought the ox was well
roasted he was frightened by the sudden approach
of a man with a forehead a yard high and a beard a
span long. This man said to the Pikeman, &lsquo;Good
morning!&rsquo; but the latter ran away instead of answering,
he was so shocked by the strange appearance of
the man.</p>

<p>Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard was quite
content at this, and, sitting down, soon finished the
whole ox. When he had ended his dinner he got up
and went away.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Sir Peppercorn and the Mill-turner
came for their dinners, and, being very hungry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>126]</a></span>
shouted from afar to the Pikeman, &lsquo;Let us dine at once!&rsquo;
But the Pikeman, keeping himself hidden among the
bushes, called out to them, &lsquo;There is nothing left for
us to eat! A little while ago Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
came up and ate up the whole ox to the
very last morsel! I was afraid of him, and so I did not
say one word against it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Peppercorn and the Mill-turner reproached their companion
bitterly for allowing all their dinner to be
stolen without once trying to prevent it, and the Mill-turner
said scornfully, &lsquo;Well, I will stop to-morrow
and look after the meat, and Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
may come if he likes!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the next day the Mill-turner stayed to roast the ox,
and his two comrades went to look after the fence they
had built round about the city.</p>

<p>Just before dinner-time Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
came out of the forest and walked
straight up to the ox, and stretched his hands out
greedily to grasp it. The Mill-turner was so frightened
by his strange appearance that he ran off as hard as he
could to look for a place to hide in.</p>

<p>By-and-by Peppercorn and the Pikeman came for
their dinners and asked angrily where the meat was.
Whereupon the Mill-turner answered, &lsquo;There is no
meat! It has all been eaten by that horrible Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard,
and his looks frightened
me so that I dared not say a single word to him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was no use complaining, so Peppercorn only said,
&lsquo;To-morrow I will stay to mind the ox, and you two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
shall go and look after the fence. I will see if we are
to remain the third day without dinner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The next morning the Pikeman and the Mill-turner
went to see if all was right round about the city, and
Peppercorn remained to roast the ox. Exactly as on the
two former days, just before dinner was ready, Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
made his appearance,
and went up to seize the meat. But Peppercorn
pushed him roughly back, saying, &lsquo;Two days I have
been dinnerless on your account, but the third day I
will not be so, as long as my head stands on my
shoulders!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Much astonished at his boldness, Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
exclaimed, &lsquo;Take care you
don&rsquo;t begin to quarrel with me. There is no one in all
the world who can conquer me, except a fellow called
Peppercorn!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Peppercorn was very pleased to hear this, and, without
more hesitation, sprang at once on Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard,
and, after some struggling,
pulled him down to the earth and bound him. This
done, he tied him fast to a tall pine-tree. Now the
Pikeman and Mill-turner came up and were exceedingly
glad to find their dinners safe. Just as they were in the
middle of their dinners, however, Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard,
with a sudden jerk, pulled up the
pine-tree by the roots and ran off with tree and all,
making furrows in the earth with it just as if three
ploughs had been passing over the ground.</p>

<p>Seeing him run off, the Pikeman and Mill-turner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
jumped up quickly and ran after him, but Peppercorn
called them back and told them to finish their dinners
first, for there would be plenty of time to catch him
after they had dined! So they all three went on eating,
and when they had done they followed the furrows
which Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard had
made in the ground. After a while they came to a deep
dark hole in the earth, and when they had examined it
all round and tried in vain on account of the darkness
to look down into it, they returned to the king and asked
him to give them a thousand miles of strong rope so
that they could go down into the pit.</p>

<p>The king at once ordered his servants to give them
what they required, and when they had got the great
cable they went back to the hole. On the way, as they
were going, they discussed which of the three should
venture down first, and it was at last settled that the
Pikeman should be let down. However, he made them
solemnly promise him that they should pull him up
again the instant he shook the rope.</p>

<p>He had been let down but a very little way before
he shook the rope, and so they pulled him up as they
had promised.</p>

<p>Then the Mill-turner said, &lsquo;Let <em>me</em> go down.&rsquo; And
so the other two lowered him, but in a moment or two
he shook the rope violently; and so he, too, was pulled
up.</p>

<p>Now Peppercorn grew angry, and exclaimed, &lsquo;I did
not think you were such cowards as to be afraid of a
dark hole! Now let <em>me</em> down!&rsquo; So they let him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
down and down until his foot touched solid ground.
Finding that he had reached the bottom, he looked
round him, and saw that he stood just in the very
middle of a most beautiful green plain&mdash;a plain so
beautiful that it was a real pleasure to look on it.</p>

<p>At one end of the plain stood a large handsome
palace, and Peppercorn went nearer to look at it. There,
in the gardens, walking, he met two young girls, and
asked them if they were not the daughters of the king?
When they said that they were, he inquired what had
become of the other sister; and the princesses told him
that their youngest sister was in the palace very busy
binding up the wounds that Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
had lately received from a certain
knight called Peppercorn.</p>

<p>Then Peppercorn told them who he was, and that he
had come down on purpose to release them, and to take
them back to the king, their father. On hearing this
good news, the two princesses rejoiced greatly, and told
Peppercorn where he would find Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
and their youngest sister. But
they warned him not to rush in on the giant, but rather
to go softly, and first try to get hold of the sabre which
hung on the wall over his bed, for this sabre possessed
the wonderful power of killing a man when he was a
whole day&rsquo;s journey from it.</p>

<p>Peppercorn took care to do as the princesses had told
him. He stole very quietly into the room where Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
was lying, and when
he was near the bed he sprang up suddenly and seized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
the sword. The moment the wounded giant saw his
sabre in the hands of Peppercorn he jumped up quickly
and ran out of the palace. Peppercorn followed him
some time before he remembered what the two princesses
had told him of the wonderful properties of the sword,
but as soon as he recollected this he made a sharp cut
with it in the air, as if he were cutting off a man&rsquo;s head,
and the moment he did so Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
fell down dead.</p>

<p>Then Peppercorn went back to the palace, and, taking
with him the three princesses, prepared to return to the
upper world.</p>

<p>When he came to the place where the rope was
hanging he took a large basket, and, placing the eldest
princess in it, fastened it to the rope, then, giving her
a note, in which he said that he sent her for the Pikeman,
he made the signal agreed upon for the rope to be
drawn up. So his comrades pulled up the rope, and
when it came down again with the empty basket,
Peppercorn sent up the second princess, after giving her
a paper, in which he had written, &lsquo;This one is for the
Mill-turner.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the rope descended the third time he sent up
the youngest princess, who was by far the most beautiful
of the three. He gave her a paper which said that this
one he meant to keep for himself. Just as the Pikeman
and the Mill-turner began to pull up the rope the
princess gave Peppercorn a little box, saying, &lsquo;Open it
when you have need of anything!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, when the Pikeman and Mill-turner drew up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
youngest princess, and saw how very beautiful she was,
they determined to leave Peppercorn down in the pit,
and go back without delay to the king&rsquo;s palace, and
there see which of them could get the youngest princess
for his wife.</p>

<p>Peppercorn waited patiently some time for the rope
to be let down that he might be drawn up but no rope
appeared. At last he was obliged to own to himself
that his two comrades had deceived and deserted him,
and, seeing how useless it was to remain standing still
any longer, he walked off without knowing where the
road would take him. Walking on, after a long time,
he came to the shore of a large lake, and heard a great
noise of crying and shouting. Very soon a multitude of
people, looking like a wedding party, made their appearance.
After placing a young girl in bridal attire on
the shore of the lake, the people left her there alone and
went away.</p>

<p>Peppercorn, seeing the girl left by herself, and
noticing how sad she looked, went up to her, and asked
her why her friends had left her there, and why she
was so sad? The girl answered, &lsquo;In this lake is a
dragon who, every year, swallows up a young girl. It
is now my turn; and our people have brought me as a
bride to the dragon, and left me to be swallowed up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Peppercorn, on hearing this, asked her to let him rest
near her a little, because he was very tired, but she
answered, &lsquo;You had far better fly away, my good
knight; if it is necessary that I should die, it is not
needful that you should die also.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
But Peppercorn said to her, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble yourself
about me, only let me rest near you a little, for I am very
tired. It will be time enough for me to run away when
the dragon comes.&rsquo; Having said this he sat down near
the girl, and in a little while fell asleep. He had not
slept long before the surface of the lake became agitated,
and the water rose up in large waves; presently the
dragon lifted its head, and swam straight to the shore
where the girl sat, evidently intending to swallow her
at once. The maiden cried bitterly, and a tear falling
on Peppercorn&rsquo;s face, awakened him. He sprang up
quickly, grasped his sword, and, smiting fiercely, with
one stroke, cut off the dragon&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>Then he took the girl by the hand, and led her back
to the city, where he found that she was the only
daughter of the king of that country. The king was
overjoyed at hearing that the dragon was killed, and
also at seeing his daughter brought back to him safe
and sound. So he insisted that Peppercorn should
marry the princess, which he did, and they all lived
together very happily for a long time.</p>

<p>After a while, however, Peppercorn began to long
greatly for the other world, and grew sadder and sadder
every day. When his wife noticed this change in his
appearance she asked him very often what ailed him,
but he would not tell her for a long time, because he
did not wish to trouble her. At last, however, he could
keep his secret no longer, and confessed to the princess
how much he longed to go back to the upper world.
Though she was very sorry to hear this, she promised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
him that she herself would beg the king to let him go,
since he so greatly wished it. This she did; and when
the king objected, not wishing to lose so good a son-in-law,
the princess said, &lsquo;Let him go; he has saved my
life, and why should we keep him against his will? My
three sons will still remain to comfort us!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king consented, saying, &lsquo;Very well; let it
be as he wishes, since you have nothing to say against
it. Tell your benefactor to go to the lake-shore, and to
say to the giant-bird he will find there, that the king
sends her his greetings, and desires her to take the
bearer of them up to the other world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The princess returned to her husband and told him
what her father had said, and then began to prepare
some provisions for the journey. When these were
ready, and the king had sent the letter for the bird,
Peppercorn took a kind leave of his wife, and went
down to the lake-shore, where he soon found the nest of
the giant-bird and her little ones in it, though she herself
was not there. So he sat down to wait under the
tree where the nest was. As he sat there, he heard the
little birds chirping very restlessly and anxiously.
Then he saw that the lake was beginning to throw up
high waves, and soon a monster came out of the water
and made straight for the nest to swallow the young
birds.</p>

<p>Peppercorn, however, did not stop long to think about
the matter, but quickly drew his wonderful sword and
killed the monster. It happened that the giant-bird
was just coming back, and when she saw Peppercorn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
under the tree, she shrieked as she ran up to kill him,
&lsquo;Now I have caught you&mdash;you who have been killing
all my little ones for so many years! Now you shall
pay me for it, for I will kill you!&rsquo; But the little birds
from their nest high in the tree, cried out to her, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
do him any harm! he has saved us from being swallowed
by a monster who came out of the lake to kill us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Peppercorn went to her, and presented
the king&rsquo;s letter. The giant-bird read it through carefully,
and then said to him, &lsquo;Go home and kill twelve
sheep. Fill their skins with water, and bring them
here, together with the flesh of the sheep.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Peppercorn went back to the king, who at once
ordered that he should be supplied with the flesh of
twelve sheep, as well as with twelve sheep-skins full of
fresh water. With this provision Peppercorn returned
to the shore of the lake.</p>

<p>Then the giant-bird placed the twelve skins full of
water under her left wing, and the flesh of the twelve
sheep under her right, and took Peppercorn on her
back. This done, she told him that he must watch well
her movements, and when she turned her beak to the
left side, he must give her water, and when she turned it
to the right he must give her meat. After impressing
these directions upon Peppercorn, the giant-bird rose
with her triple load in the air, and flew straight up
towards the other world. As she flew she turned, from
time to time, her beak, now to the left and then to the
right, and Peppercorn gave her water or meat, as she
had directed him to do. At last, however, all the meat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
disappeared. So, when the giant-bird turned her beak
once more to the right, Sir Peppercorn, having no more
meat to give her, and fearing some evil might happen
if he did not satisfy her, took out his knife, and, cutting
a piece of flesh from the sole of his right foot, gave it
to her.</p>

<p>But the bird knew by the taste that he had cut it
from his own foot, so she did not swallow it, but hid it
under her tongue, and held it there until she reached
the other world.</p>

<p>Then she set Peppercorn down on the earth and told
him to walk, and when he tried to do so he was forced
to limp, because of the loss of part of his foot.
When the giant-bird noticed this, she asked him,
&lsquo;Why do you limp so?&rsquo; To this Peppercorn
answered, &lsquo;Oh, it is nothing! Do not trouble yourself
about it!&rsquo; But the bird told him to lift his right foot,
and when he did so, she took the piece of flesh she had
kept hidden under her tongue, and laid it on the place
where he had cut it from. Then she tapped it two or
three times with her beak to make it grow to the rest
of the foot.</p>

<p>Peppercorn walked on some time before he remembered
the little box which the youngest of the three
daughters of the king had given him. Now, however,
he opened it, and a bee and a fly flew out and asked
him what he desired. He said, &lsquo;I want a good horse to
carry me to the king&rsquo;s residence, and a decent suit of
clothes to wear.&rsquo; Next moment a suit of good clothes
lay before him, and a handsome horse stood ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
saddled for him to mount. Then he took the clothes,
and, mounting the horse, rode off to the city where the
king dwelt. Before entering the city, however, he
opened his little box, and said to the fly and the bee, &lsquo;I
do not want the horse any more at present.&rsquo; Accordingly
they took it with them into their little box.</p>

<p>Peppercorn went to live in the house of an old woman
in the city. Next morning he heard the public crier
shouting in the street, &lsquo;Is there any one bold enough to
fight with the mighty Pikeman, the king&rsquo;s son-in-law?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Peppercorn was very pleased to hear this challenge,
and, opening his box without delay, told the bee and
fly, who flew out to receive his orders, that he wanted at
once a fine suit of clothes and a strong charger, so that
he might go to fight with the Pikeman. The bee and
fly instantly gave him what he required, and he dressed
himself and rode off to the field, where he found the
Pikeman proudly awaiting any one who might presume
to accept his challenge.</p>

<p>So Peppercorn and the Pikeman fought, and before
very long the first son-in-law of the king was slain.
Then Peppercorn returned home quickly, and opening
his box, bade the bee and fly take away the horse and
the fine clothes.</p>

<p>The king sought everywhere for the stranger who had
killed his son-in-law, but no one knew anything about
him. So, after some days, the city crier went round
again, proclaiming that the Mill-turner, the second son-in-law
of the king, would fight any one who dared to
meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
Peppercorn again let out his bee and his fly, and
asked for a finer horse and handsomer clothes than
the last. So they brought him a very gorgeous suit,
and a most beautiful coal-black charger, and with these
he went on the field to meet the Mill-turner. They
fought, but Peppercorn soon killed the king&rsquo;s second
son-in-law, and again went to his lodgings, where he
ordered the bee and fly to take the horse and clothes
with them into their little box.</p>

<p>Now, not only the king, but all his people were very
much puzzled as to who the powerful knight could be,
who had killed the two valiant sons-in-law of the king.
So a strict search was made, and he was sought everywhere.
But no one could tell anything about him;
while such horses as he rode, and such clothes as he
wore were not to be found in the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>Some time had passed since the king&rsquo;s sons-in-law
had been killed, and people had begun to be a little
quieter and had given up all hope of finding out who
the stronger knight might be. Then Peppercorn wrote
a letter to the king&rsquo;s youngest daughter, and sent it to
her by the old woman in whose house he lived. In the
letter he told the princess everything that had happened
to him since he had sent up in the basket to his false
comrades, and told her also that he himself had slain
both of the traitors in fair fight.</p>

<p>The young princess, as soon as she had read the letter,
quickly ran to her father and begged him to pardon
Peppercorn. The king saw he could not justly deny her
this favour, since the two men who had been killed had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
deceived and deserted their friend, without whose
superior courage they would never have been themselves
his sons-in-law, seeing that all the three princesses,
but for Peppercorn, must have remained in the
other world where Yard-high-forehead-and-span-long-beard
had carried them.</p>

<p>So, after thinking all this over in his mind, the king
told his daughter that he willingly forgave Peppercorn,
and that she might invite him to the palace. This the
princess did at once, and very soon after Peppercorn
made his appearance before the king in splendid attire,
and was received very kindly.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards, the marriage of Peppercorn with
the beautiful princess, the king&rsquo;s youngest daughter,
was celebrated with great rejoicings, and the king built
them a fine house near his palace to live in.</p>

<p>There Peppercorn and his princess lived long and
happily, and he never had any wish to wander again
about the world.</p>

<h2><a name="chap17" id="chap17"></a>BASH-CHALEK; OR, TRUE STEEL.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was a king who had three
sons and three daughters. At length old age overtook
him, and the hour came for him to die. While
dying he called to him his three sons and three
daughters, and told his sons to let their sisters marry the
very first men who came to ask them in marriage. &lsquo;Do
this, or dread my curse!&rsquo; said he, and soon after expired.</p>

<p>Some time after his death there came one night a great
knocking at the gate; the whole palace shook, and outside
was heard a great noise of squeaking, singing, and
shouting, whilst lightnings played round the whole court
of the palace. The people in the palace were very much
frightened, so that they shook for fear, when all at once
some one shouted from the outside, &lsquo;O princes! open the
door!&rsquo; Thereupon the king&rsquo;s eldest son said, &lsquo;Do not
open!&rsquo; The second son added, &lsquo;Do not open, for anything
in the world!&rsquo; But the youngest son said, &lsquo;I
will open the door!&rsquo; and he jumped up and opened it.</p>

<p>The moment he had opened the door something came
in, but the brother could see nothing except a bright
light in one part of the room; out of this light came these
words: &lsquo;I have come to demand your eldest sister for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
wife, and I shall take her away this moment, without
any delay; for I wait for nothing, neither will I come a
second time to ask her! Therefore answer me quickly&mdash;will
you give her or not?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The eldest brother said, &lsquo;I will not give her. How
can I give her when I cannot see you, and do not know
who you are, nor whence you come? You come to-night
for the first time, and wish to take her away instantly!
Should I not know where I can visit my sister
sometimes?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The second said, &lsquo;I will not give my sister to-night to
be taken away!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the youngest said, &lsquo;I will give her if you will not.
Have you forgotten what our father commanded us?&rsquo;
and, with these words, taking his sister by the hand,
he gave her away, saying, &lsquo;May she be to you a happy
and honest wife!&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the sister passed over the threshold every one
in the palace fell to the ground from fear, so vivid was
the lightning and loud the claps of thunder. The
heavens seemed to be on fire and the whole sky rumbled,
so that the whole palace shook as if about to fall. All
this however passed over, and soon after the day
dawned; when it grew light enough, the brothers went
to see if any trace was left of the mighty power, to
whom they had given their sister, so that they might be
able to trace the road by which it had gone. There
was, however, nothing which they could either see or
hear.</p>

<p>The second night, about the same time, there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
heard again round the whole palace a great noise, as if
an army was whistling and hissing, and at length some
one at the door cried out, &lsquo;Open the door, O princes!&rsquo;
They were afraid to disobey, and opened the door, and
some dreadful power began to speak, &lsquo;Give here the
girl, your second sister! I am come to demand her!&rsquo;
The eldest brother answered, &lsquo;I will not give her away!&rsquo;
The second brother said, &lsquo;I will not give you my sister!&rsquo;
But the youngest said, &lsquo;I will give her! Have you
forgotten what our father told us to do?&rsquo; So he took
his sister by the hand and gave her over, saying, &lsquo;Take
her! may she be honest and bring you happiness!&rsquo;
Then the unseen noises departed with the girl. Next
day, as soon as it dawned, all three brothers walked
round the palace, and for some distance beyond, looking
everywhere for some trace where the power had gone,
but nothing could be seen nor heard.</p>

<p>The third night, at the same hour as before, again the
palace rocked from its very foundations, and there was
a mighty uproar outside. Then a voice shouted, &lsquo;Open
the door!&rsquo; The sons of the king arose and opened the
door, and a great power passed by them and said, &lsquo;I am
come to demand your youngest sister!&rsquo; The eldest and
the second son shouted, &lsquo;No! we will not give our sister
this third night! At any rate, we will know before our
youngest sister goes away from our house to whom we
are giving her, and where she is going, so that we can
come to visit her whenever we wish to do so!&rsquo; Thereupon
the youngest brother said, &lsquo;Then I will give her!
Have you forgotten what our father on his death-bed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
recommended us? It is not so very long ago!&rsquo; Then
he took the girl by the hand and said, &lsquo;Here she is!
Take her! and may she bring you happiness and be
happy herself!&rsquo; Then instantly the power went away
with a great noise. When the day dawned the brothers
were very anxious about the fate of their sister, but
could find no trace of the way in which she had gone.</p>

<p>Some time after the brothers, speaking together,
said, &lsquo;Good God! it is really very wonderful what has
happened to our sisters! We have no news&mdash;no trace
of them! We do not know where they are gone, nor
whom they have married!&rsquo; At last they said to each
other, &lsquo;Let us go and try to find our sisters!&rsquo; So they
prepared immediately for their journey, took money for
their travelling expenses, and went away in search of
their three sisters.</p>

<p>They had travelled some time when they lost their
way in a forest, and wandered about a whole day.
When it grew dark they thought they would stop for
the night at some place where they could find water.
So, having come to a lake, they decided to sleep near
it, and sat down to take some supper. When the
time for sleep came the eldest brother said, &lsquo;I will
keep watch while you sleep!&rsquo; and so the two younger
brothers went to sleep and the eldest watched. In
the middle of the night the lake began to be greatly
agitated, and the brother who was watching grew quite
frightened, especially when he saw something was
coming towards him from the middle of the lake. When
it came near he saw that it was a terrific alligator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
with two ears, and it ran at him; but he drew his
knife and struck it, and cut off its head. When he
had done this he cut off the ears also, and put them in
his pocket, the body and the head, however, he threw
back into the lake. Meanwhile the day began to
dawn, but the two brothers slept on and knew nothing
of what their eldest brother had done. At length he
awakened them, but told them nothing, so they went on
their travels together. When the next day was closing,
and it began again to grow dark, they took counsel
with each other where they should rest for the night,
and where they should find water. They felt also
afraid, because they were approaching some dangerous
mountains.</p>

<p>Coming to a small lake they resolved to rest there
that night; and having made a fire they placed their
things near it, and prepared to sleep. Then the second
brother said, &lsquo;This night I will keep guard whilst you
sleep!&rsquo; So the two others fell asleep, and the second
brother remained watching.</p>

<p>All at once the lake began to move, and lo! an alligator,
with two heads, came running to swallow up the
three. But the brother who watched grasped his knife,
felled the alligator to the ground with one blow, and
cut off both the heads. Having done this he cut off
the two pairs of ears, put them in his pocket, and threw
the body into the water, and the two heads after it.
The other brothers, however, knew nothing about the
danger which they had escaped, and continued to sleep
very soundly till the morning dawned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
Then the second brother awoke them, saying, &lsquo;Arise,
my brothers! It is day!&rsquo; and they instantly jumped
up, and prepared to continue their journey. But they
knew not in what country they now were, and as they
had eaten up nearly all their food, they feared greatly
lest they should die of hunger in that unknown land.
So they prayed God to give them sight of some city or
village or, at least, that they might meet some one to
guide them, for they had already been wandering three
days up and down in a wilderness, and could see no end
to it. Pretty early in the morning they came to a
large lake and resolved to go no further, but remain
there all the day, and also to spend the night there.
&lsquo;For if we go on,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;we are not sure that we
shall find any more water near which we can rest.&rsquo; So
they remained there.</p>

<p>When evening came they made a great fire, took
their frugal supper, and prepared to sleep. Then the
youngest brother said, &lsquo;This night I will keep guard
whilst you sleep;&rsquo; and so the other two went to sleep,
and the youngest brother kept awake, looking sharply
about him, his eyes being turned often towards the lake.
Part of the night had already passed, when suddenly the
whole lake began to move, the waves dashed over the
fire and half quenched it. Then he drew his sword and
placed himself near the fire, as there appeared a great
alligator with three heads, which rushed upon the
brothers as if about to swallow them all three.</p>

<p>But the youngest brother had a brave heart, and
would not awaken his brothers, so he met the alligator,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
and gave him three blows in succession, and at each
blow he cut off one of the three heads. Then he cut off
the six ears and put them in his pocket, and threw the
body and the three heads into the lake. Whilst he
was thus busy the fire had quite gone out, so he&mdash;having
nothing there with which he could light the
fire, and not wishing to awaken his brothers from their
deep slumbers&mdash;stepped a little way into the forest,
with the hope of seeing something with which he might
rekindle the fire.</p>

<p>There was, however, no trace of any fire anywhere.
At last, in his search, he climbed up a very high tree,
and, having reached the top, looked about on all sides.
After much looking he thought he saw the glare of a
fire not very far off. So he came down from the tree
and went in the direction in which he had seen the fire,
in order to get some brand with which he might again
light the fire. He walked very far on this errand, and
though the glare seemed always near him, it was a very
long time before he reached it. Suddenly, however, he
came upon a cave, and in the cave a great fire was
burning. Round it sat nine giants, and two men were
being roasted, one on each side of the fire. Besides
that, there stood upon the fire a great kettle full of the
limbs of men ready to be cooked. When the king&rsquo;s son
saw that, he was terrified and would gladly have gone
back, but it was no longer possible.</p>

<p>Then he shouted as loud and cheerfully as he could,
&lsquo;Good evening, my dear comrades! I have been a
very long time in search of you!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
They received him well, saying, &lsquo;Welcome! if thou
art of our company!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He answered, &lsquo;I shall remain yours for ever, and
would give my life for your sake!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;if you intend to be one of us, you
know, you must also eat man&rsquo;s flesh, and go out with us
in search of prey?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s son answered, &lsquo;Certainly; I shall do
everything that you do!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then come and sit with us!&rsquo; cried the giants; and
the whole company, sitting round the fire, took meat
out of the kettle and began to eat. The king&rsquo;s son pretended
to eat, also, but instead of eating he always
threw the meat behind him, and thus deceived them.</p>

<p>When they had eaten up the whole of the roasted
meat, the giants got up and said, &lsquo;Let us now go to
hunt, that we may have meat for to-morrow.&rsquo; So
they went away, all nine of them, the king&rsquo;s son making
the tenth. &lsquo;Come along!&rsquo; they said to him, &lsquo;there is
a city near in which a great king lives. We have been
supplying ourselves with food from that city a great
many years.&rsquo; As they came near the city they pulled
two tall pine-trees up by the roots, and carried them
along with them. Having come to the city wall, they
reared one pine-tree up against it, and said to the king&rsquo;s
son, &lsquo;Go up, now, to the top of the wall, so that we may
be able to give you the other pine-tree, which you must
take by the top and throw down into the city. Take
care, however,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;to keep the top of the tree
in your hands, so that we can go down the stem of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
into the city.&rsquo; Thereupon the king&rsquo;s son climbed up
on the wall and then cried out to them, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to do; I am not acquainted with this place, and I
don&rsquo;t understand how to throw the tree over the wall;
please one of you come up and show me what I must do.&rsquo;
Then one of the giants climbed up the tree placed
against the wall, caught the top of the other pine-tree,
and threw it over the wall, keeping the top all the time
safe in his hand. Whilst he was thus standing, the
king&rsquo;s son drew his sword, struck him on the neck, and
cut his head off, so that the giant fell down into the city.</p>

<p>Then he called to the other eight giants, &lsquo;Your
brother is in the city; come, one after the other, so that
I can let you also down into the city!&rsquo; And the
giants, not knowing what had happened to the first
one, climbed up one after the other, and thus the king&rsquo;s
son cut off their heads till he had killed all the nine.</p>

<p>After that, he himself slowly descended the pine-tree
and went into the city, walking through all the
streets, but there was not one living creature to be seen.
The city seemed quite deserted. Then he said to himself,
&lsquo;Surely those giants have made this great devastation
and carried all the people away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After walking about a very long time, he came to a
tall tower, and, looking up, he saw a light in one of the
rooms. So he opened the door, and went up the steps,
into the room. And what a beautiful room it was in
which he had entered! It was decorated with gold and
silk and velvet, and there was no one there except a girl
lying on a couch, sleeping. As soon as the king&rsquo;s son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
entered, his eyes fell upon the girl, who was exceedingly
beautiful. Just then he saw a large serpent coming
down the wall, and it had stretched out its head and was
ready to strike the girl on the forehead, between the
eyes. So he drew his dagger very quickly, and nailed
the snake&rsquo;s head to the wall, exclaiming, &lsquo;God grant
that my dagger may not be taken out of the wall by any
hand but my own!&rsquo; and thereupon he hurried away, and
passed over the city wall, climbing up and going down
the pine-trees. When he got back to the cavern where
the giants had been, he plucked a brand from the fire,
and ran away very quickly to the spot where he had left
his two brothers, and found them still sleeping.</p>

<p>He soon lighted the fire again, and meanwhile the
sun having arisen he awoke his brothers, and they arose
and all three continued their journey. The same day
they came to the road leading to the city. In that city
lived a mighty king, who used to walk about the streets
every morning, weeping over the great destruction of his
people by the giants. The king feared greatly that one
day his own daughter might also be eaten up by one of
them. That morning he rose very early, and went to
look about the city; the streets were all empty, because
most of the people of the city had been eaten up
by the giants. Walking about, at last he observed a
tall pine-tree, pulled up quite by the roots, and leaning
against the city wall. He drew near, and saw a great
wonder. Nine giants, the frightful enemies of his
people, were lying there with their heads off. When
the king saw that he rejoiced exceedingly, and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
people who were left, gathered round and praised God,
and prayed for good health and good luck to those who
had killed the giants. At that moment a servant came
running, to tell the king that a serpent had very nearly
killed his daughter. So the king hurried back to the
palace, and went quickly to the room wherein his
daughter was, and there he saw the snake pinned to the
wall, with a dagger through its head. He tried to draw
the knife out, but he was not able to do so.</p>

<p>Then the king sent a proclamation to all the corners
of the kingdom, announcing that whoever had killed the
nine giants and nailed the snake to the wall, should
come to the king, who would make him great presents
and give him his daughter for a wife. This was proclaimed
throughout the whole kingdom. The king
ordered, moreover, that large inns should be built on all
the principal roads, and that every traveller who passed
by should be asked if he had ever heard of the man who
had killed the nine giants, and any traveller who knew
anything about the matter should come and tell what he
knew to the king, when he should be well rewarded.</p>

<p>After some time the three brothers, travelling in
search of their sisters, came one night to sleep at one of
those inns. After supper the master of the inn came in
to speak to them, and, after boasting very much what
great things he had himself done, he asked them if they
themselves had ever done any great thing?</p>

<p>Then the eldest brother began to speak, and said,
&lsquo;After I started with my brothers on this journey, one
night we stopped to sleep by a lake in the midst of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
great forest; whilst my two brothers slept I watched,
and, suddenly, an alligator came out of the lake to
swallow us, but I took my knife and cut off its head;
if you don&rsquo;t believe me, see! here are the two ears
from his head!&rsquo; And he took the ears from his pocket
and threw them on the table.</p>

<p>When the second brother heard that, he said, &lsquo;I kept
guard the second night, and I killed an alligator with
two heads; if you do not believe me, look! here are its
four ears!&rsquo; and he took the ears out of his pocket and
showed them.</p>

<p>But the youngest brother kept silence. The master
of the inn began then to speak, to him, saying, &lsquo;Well,
my boy, your brothers are brave men; let us hear if you
have not done some bold deed.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the youngest brother began, &lsquo;I have also done
something, though it may not be a great thing. When
we stayed to rest the third night in the great wilderness
on the shore of the lake, my brothers lay down to
sleep, for it was my turn to keep guard. In the middle
of the night the water stirred mightily, and a three-headed
alligator came out and wished to swallow us, but
I drew my sword and cut off all the three heads; if you
do not believe, see! here are the six ears of the alligator!&rsquo;
The brothers themselves were greatly surprised,
and he continued: &lsquo;Meanwhile the fire had gone out,
and I went in search of fire. Wandering about the
mountain I met nine giants in one cave;&rsquo; and so he
went on, telling all that had happened and what he had
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
When the innkeeper heard that he hurried off and
told everything to the king. The king gave him plenty
of money, and sent some of his men to bring the three
brothers to him. When they came to the king, he
asked the youngest, &lsquo;Have you really done all these
wonders in this city&mdash;killed the giants and saved my
daughter from death?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, your majesty,&rsquo; answered
the king&rsquo;s son. Then the king gave him his daughter
to wife, and allowed him to take the first place after him
in the kingdom. After that he said to the two elder
brothers, &lsquo;If you like I will also find wives for you two,
and build palaces for you.&rsquo; But they thanked him, saying
they were already married, and so told him how
they had left home to search for their sisters. When
the king heard that, he kept by him only the youngest
brother, his son-in-law, and gave the other two each a
mule loaded with sacks full of money; and so the two
elder brothers went back to their kingdom. All the
time, however, the youngest brother was thinking of his
three sisters, and many a time he wished to go in search
of them again, though he was also sorry to leave his
wife. The king would never consent to his going, so
the prince wasted away slowly without speaking about
his grief.</p>

<p>One day the king went out hunting, and said to his
son-in-law, &lsquo;Remain here in the palace, and take these
nine keys, and keep them carefully. If you wish, however,&rsquo;
added he, &lsquo;you can open three or four rooms,
wherein you will see plenty of gold and silver, and other
precious things. Indeed, if you much wish to do so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
you can open eight of the rooms, but let nothing in the
world tempt you to open the ninth. If you open that,
woe to you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king went away, leaving his son-in-law in the
palace, who immediately began to open one room after
another, till he had opened the whole eight, and he saw
in all masses of all sorts of precious things. When he
stood before the door of the ninth room, he said to himself,
&lsquo;I have passed luckily through all kinds of adventures,
and now I must not dare to open this door!&rsquo; thereupon
he opened it. And what did he see? In the
room was a man, whose legs were bound in iron up to
the knees, and his arms to the elbows; in the four
corners of the chamber there were four columns, and
from each an iron chain, and all the chains met in a
ring round the man&rsquo;s neck. So fast was he bound that
he could not move at all any way. In the front of him
was a reservoir, and from it water was streaming
through a golden pipe into a golden basin, just before
him. Near him stood, also, a golden mug, all covered
with precious stones. The man looked at the water and
longed to drink, but he could not move to reach the cup.
When the king&rsquo;s son saw that, he was greatly surprised,
and stepped back; but the man cried, &lsquo;Come in, I conjure
you in the name of the living God!&rsquo; Then the
prince again approached, and the man said, &lsquo;Do a good
deed for the sake of the life hereafter. Give me a cup of
water to drink, and be assured you will receive, as a recompense
from me, another life.&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son
thought, &lsquo;It is well, after all, to have two lives,&rsquo; so he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
took the mug and filled it, and gave it to the man, who
emptied it at once. Then the prince asked him, &lsquo;Now
tell me, what is your name?&rsquo; And the man answered,
&lsquo;My name is True Steel.&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son moved to go
away, but the man begged again, &lsquo;Give me yet one cup
of water, and I will give you in addition a second life.&rsquo;
The prince said to himself, &lsquo;One life is mine already,
and he offers to give me another&mdash;that is, indeed, wonderful!&rsquo;
So he took the mug and gave it to him,
and the man drank it up. The prince began
already to fasten the door, while the man called
to him, &lsquo;Oh, my brave one, come back a moment! You
have done two good deeds, do yet a third one, and I will
give you a third life. Take the mug, fill it with water,
and pour the water on my head, and for that I will give
you a third life.&rsquo; When the king&rsquo;s son heard that, he
turned, filled the beaker with water, and poured it over
the man&rsquo;s head, the moment the water met his head
all the fastenings around the man&rsquo;s neck broke,
all the iron chains burst asunder. True Steel
jumped up like lightning, spread his wings, and started
to fly, taking with him the king&rsquo;s daughter, the wife of
his deliverer, with whom he disappeared. What was to
be done now? The prince was afraid of the king&rsquo;s
anger.</p>

<p>When the king returned from the chase, his son-in-law
told him all that had happened, and the king was
very sorry and said to him, &lsquo;Why did you do this? I
told you not to open the ninth room!&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son
answered, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with me! I will go and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
find True Steel and bring my wife back!&rsquo; Then the
king attempted to persuade him not to go away: &lsquo;Do
not go, for anything in the world!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you do not
know True Steel. It cost me very many soldiers and
much money to catch him! Better remain here, and I
will find you some other maiden for a wife; do not fear,
for I love you as my own son, notwithstanding all that
has happened!&rsquo; The prince, however, would not hear
of remaining there, so taking some money for his
journey he saddled and bridled his horse, and started on
his travels in search of True Steel.</p>

<p>After travelling a long time, he one day entered a
strange city, and, as he was looking about, a girl called
to him from a kiosk, &lsquo;O son of the king, dismount from
your horse and come into the forecourt.&rsquo; When he
entered the courtyard the girl met him, and on looking
at her he recognised his eldest sister. They greeted
each other, and the sister said to him, &lsquo;Come, my
brother&mdash;come with me into the kiosk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When they came into the kiosk, he asked her who her
husband was, and she answered, &lsquo;I am married to the
King of Dragons, who is also a dragon. I must hide
you well, my dear brother, for my husband has often
said that he would kill his brothers-in-law if he could
only meet them. I will try him first, and if he will
promise not to injure you, I will tell him you are here.&rsquo;
So she hid her brother and his horse as well as she
could. At night, supper was prepared in readiness for
her husband, and at last he came. When he came flying
into the courtyard, the whole palace shone. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
moment he came in, he called his wife and said, &lsquo;Wife,
there is a smell of human bones here! Tell me directly
what it is!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is no one here!&rsquo; said she. But he exclaimed,
&lsquo;That is not true!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then his wife said, &lsquo;My dear, will you answer me
truly what I am going to ask you? Would you do any
harm to my brothers, if one of them came here to
see me?&rsquo; And the dragon answered, &lsquo;Your eldest and
your second brother I would kill and roast, but I would
do no harm to the youngest.&rsquo; Then his wife said,
&lsquo;Well, then, I will tell you that my youngest brother,
and your brother-in-law, is here.&rsquo; When the Dragon
King heard that he said, &lsquo;Let him come to me!&rsquo; So
the sister led the brother before the king, her husband,
and he embraced him. They kissed each other, and the
king exclaimed: &lsquo;Welcome, brother-in-law!&rsquo; &lsquo;I hope
I find you well?&rsquo; returned the prince courteously, and
he told the Dragon King all his adventures from the
beginning to the end.</p>

<p>Then the Dragon King cried out, &lsquo;And where are
you going, my poor fellow? The day before yesterday
True Steel passed here carrying away your wife. I
assailed him with seven thousand dragons, yet could do
him no harm. Leave the devil in peace; I will give
you as much money as you like and then go home
quietly.&rsquo; But the king&rsquo;s son would not hear of going
back, and proposed next morning to continue his
journey. When the Dragon King saw that he could not
change his intention, he took one of his feathers, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
gave it into his hand, saying, &lsquo;Remember what I now
say to you. Here you have one of my feathers, and if
you find True Steel and are greatly pressed, burn this
feather, and I will come in an instant to your help
with all my forces.&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son took the feather
and continued his journey.</p>

<p>After long travelling about the world he arrived at
a great city, and, as he rode through the streets, a
girl called to him from a kiosk: &lsquo;Here, son of the
king! Dismount and come into the courtyard!&rsquo; The
prince led his horse into the yard, and behold! the
second sister came to meet him. They embraced and
kissed each other, and the sister led the brother up
into the kiosk, and had his horse taken to a stable.
When they were in the kiosk, the sister asked her
brother how he came there, and he told her all his
adventures. He then asked her who her husband was.
&lsquo;I am married to the King of the Falcons,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;and he will come home to-night, so I must hide you
somewhere, for he often threatens my brothers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after she had concealed her brother, the
Falcon King came home. As soon as he alighted all
the house shook. Immediately his supper was set
before him, but he said to his wife, &lsquo;There are human
bones somewhere!&rsquo; The wife answered, &lsquo;No, my
husband, there is nothing;&rsquo; after long talking, however,
she asked him, &lsquo;Would you harm my brothers if
they came to see me?&rsquo; The Falcon King answered,
&lsquo;The eldest brother and the second I would delight in
torturing, but to the youngest I would do no harm.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
So she told him about her brother. Then he ordered
that they should bring him immediately; and when he
saw him, he rose up and they embraced and kissed each
other. &lsquo;Welcome, brother-in-law!&rsquo; said the King of
Falcons. &lsquo;I hope you are happy, brother?&rsquo; returned
the prince, and then they sat down to sup together.
After supper, the Falcon King asked his brother-in-law
where he was travelling. He replied that he was going
in search of True Steel, and told the king all that had
happened.</p>

<p>On hearing this the Falcon King began to advise
him to go no farther. &lsquo;It is no use going on,&rsquo; said
he. &lsquo;I will tell you something of True Steel. The
day he stole your wife, I assaulted him with four
thousand falcons. We had a terrible battle with him,
blood was shed till it reached the knees, but yet we
could do him no harm! Do you think now, that you
alone could do anything with him? I advise you to
return home. Here is my treasure: take with you as
much as you like.&rsquo; But the king&rsquo;s son answered, &lsquo;I
thank you for all your kindness, but I cannot return.
I shall go at all events in search of True Steel!&rsquo; For
he thought to himself, &lsquo;Why should I not go, seeing
I have three lives?&rsquo; When the Falcon King saw that
he could not persuade him to go back, he took a little
feather and gave it him, saying, &lsquo;Take this feather,
and when you find yourself in great need, burn it and
I will instantly come with all my powers to help you!&rsquo;
So the king&rsquo;s son took the feather and continued his
journey, hoping to find True Steel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
After travelling for a long time about the world he
came to a third city. As he entered, a girl called to
him from a kiosk, &lsquo;Dismount, and come into the courtyard.&rsquo;
The king&rsquo;s son went into the yard, and was
surprised to find his youngest sister, who came to meet
him. When they had embraced and kissed each other,
the sister led her brother to the kiosk and sent his horse
to the stables. The brother asked her, &lsquo;Dear sister,
whom have you married? What is your husband?&rsquo;
She answered, &lsquo;My husband is the King of Eagles.&rsquo;
When the Eagle King returned home in the evening
his wife received him, but he exclaimed immediately,
&lsquo;What man has come into my palace? Tell me the
truth instantly!&rsquo; She answered, &lsquo;No one is here;&rsquo;
and they began their supper. By-and-by the wife said,
&lsquo;Tell me truly: would you do any harm to my brothers
if they came here?&rsquo; The Eagle King answered, &lsquo;The
eldest and second brother I would kill, but to the
youngest I would do no harm! I would help him whenever
I could!&rsquo; Then the wife said, &lsquo;My youngest
brother, and your brother-in-law, is here; he came to
see me.&rsquo; The Eagle King ordered that they should
bring the prince instantly, received him standing,
kissed him, and said, &lsquo;Welcome, brother-in-law!&rsquo; and
the king&rsquo;s son answered, &lsquo;I hope you are well?&rsquo; They
then sat down to their supper. During the repast they
conversed about many things, and at last the prince told
the king he was travelling in search of True Steel.
When the Eagle King heard that, he tried to dissuade
him from going on, adding, &lsquo;Leave the devil in peace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>159]</a></span>
my brother-in-law; give up that journey and stay with
me! I will do everything to satisfy you!&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son
however, would not hear of remaining, but next day,
as soon as it dawned, prepared to set out in search of
True Steel. Then the Eagle King, seeing that he could
not persuade him to give up his journey, plucked out
one of his feathers and gave it him, saying, &lsquo;If you find
yourself in great danger, my brother, make a fire and
burn this feather; I will then come to your help immediately
with all my eagles.&rsquo; So the prince took the
feather and went away.</p>

<p>After travelling for a very long time about the world,
roaming from one city to another, and always going
farther and farther from his home, he found his wife in
a cavern.</p>

<p>When the wife saw him she was greatly astonished,
and cried, &lsquo;In God&rsquo;s name, my husband, how did you
come here?&rsquo; He told her how it all happened, and
then added, &lsquo;Now let us fly!&rsquo; &lsquo;How can we fly,&rsquo; she
asked, &lsquo;when True Steel will reach us instantly? and
when he does he will kill you, and carry me back.&rsquo; But
the prince, knowing he had three other lives to live,
persuaded his wife to flee, and so they did. As soon,
however, as they started, True Steel heard it, and followed
immediately. When he reached them, he
shouted to the king&rsquo;s son, &lsquo;So, prince, you have stolen
your wife!&rsquo; Then, after taking the wife back, he
added, &lsquo;Now, I forgive you this life, because I recollect
that I promised to give you three lives; but go away
directly, and never come here again after your wife,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
else you will be lost!&rsquo; Thus saying, he carried the
wife away, and the prince remained alone on the spot,
not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>At length the prince resolved to go back to his wife.
When he came near the cave he found an opportunity
when True Steel was absent, and took his wife again
and tried to escape with her.</p>

<p>But True Steel learned their flight directly, and ran
after them. When he reached them, he fixed an arrow
to his bow, and cried to the king&rsquo;s son, &lsquo;Do you prefer
to die by the arrow or by the sword?&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son
asked pardon, and True Steel said, &lsquo;I pardon you also
the second life; but I warn you! never come here again
after your wife, for I will not pardon you any more!
I shall kill you on the spot!&rsquo; Saying that, he carried
the wife back to the cave, and the prince remained
thinking all the time how he could save her.</p>

<p>At last he said to himself, &lsquo;Why should I fear True
Steel, when I have yet two lives? One of which he
has made me a present, and one which is my own?&rsquo;
So he decided to return again to the cave next morning,
when True Steel was absent. He saw his wife, and
said to her, &lsquo;Let us fly!&rsquo; She objected, saying, &lsquo;It is
of no use to fly, when True Steel would certainly overtake
us.&rsquo; However, her husband forced her to go with
him, and they went away. True Steel, however, overtook
them quickly, and shouted, &lsquo;Wait a bit! This
time I will not pardon you!&rsquo; The prince became
afraid, and begged him to pardon him also this time,
and True Steel said to him, &lsquo;You know I promised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
give you three lives, so now I give you this one, but it
is the third and last. Now you have only one life, so
go home, and do not risk losing the one life God gave
you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the prince, seeing he could do nothing against
this great power, turned back, reflecting, however, all
the time, as to the best way of getting his wife back
from True Steel.</p>

<p>At last, he remembered what his brothers-in-law had
said to him when they gave him their feathers. Then
he said to himself, &lsquo;I will try this fourth time to get
my wife back; if I come to trouble, I will burn the
feathers, and see if my brothers-in-law will come to
help me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hereupon he went back once more towards the cavern
wherein his wife was kept, and, as he saw from a
distance that True Steel was just leaving the cave, he
went near and showed himself to his wife. She was
surprised and terrified, and exclaimed, &lsquo;Are you so tired
of your life that you come back again to me?&rsquo; Then
he told her about his brothers-in-law, and how each of
them had given him one of their feathers, and had
promised to come to help him whenever he needed their
assistance. &lsquo;Therefore,&rsquo; added he, &lsquo;I am come once
more to take you away; let us start at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This they did. The same moment, however, True
Steel heard of it, and shouted from afar, &lsquo;Stop, prince!
You cannot run away!&rsquo; And then the king&rsquo;s son,
seeing True Steel so near him, quickly took out a flint
and tinder-box, struck some sparks, and burned all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
three feathers. Whilst he was doing this, however,
True Steel reached him, and, with his sword, cut the
prince in two parts. That moment came the King of
Dragons, rushing with his whole army of dragons, the
King of Falcons, with all his falcons, and the King of
Eagles, with his mighty host of eagles, and they all
attacked True Steel. Torrents of blood were shed, but
after all True Steel caught up the woman and fled
away.</p>

<p>Then the three kings gave all their attention to their
brother-in-law, and determined to bring him back to
life. Thereupon they asked three of the most active
dragons which of them could bring them, in the shortest
time, some water from the river Jordan.</p>

<p>One said, &lsquo;I could bring it in half an hour.&rsquo; The
second said, &lsquo;I can go and return in ten minutes.&rsquo;
The third dragon said, &lsquo;I can bring it in nine seconds.&rsquo;
Then the three kings said to the last one, &lsquo;Go, dragon;
and make haste!&rsquo; Then this dragon exhibited all his
fiery might, and in nine seconds, as he had promised,
he came back with water from the Jordan.</p>

<p>The kings took the water and poured it on the places
where the prince was wounded, and, as they did so, the
wound closed up, the body joined together, and the
king&rsquo;s son sprang up alive.</p>

<p>Then the three kings counselled him: &lsquo;Now that you
are saved from death, go home!&rsquo; But the prince
answered, he would at all events yet once more try to
get his wife back. The kings, his brothers-in-law,
again spoke, &lsquo;Do not try again! Indeed, you will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
lost if you go, for now you have only one life which
God gave you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s son, however, would not listen to their
advice. So the kings told him, &lsquo;Well then, if you are
still determined to go, at least do not take your wife
away immediately, but tell her to ask True Steel where
his strength lies, and then come and tell us, in order that
we may help you to conquer him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the prince went secretly and saw his wife, and told
her how she could persuade True Steel to tell her where
his strength was. He then left her and went away.</p>

<p>When True Steel came home, the wife of the king&rsquo;s
son asked him, &lsquo;Tell me, now, where is your great
strength?&rsquo; He answered, &lsquo;My wife, my strength is in
my sword!&rsquo; Then she began to pray, and turned to his
sword. When True Steel saw that, he burst out laughing,
and said, &lsquo;O foolish woman! my strength is not in
my sword, but in my bow and arrows!&rsquo; Then she
turned towards the bow and arrows and prayed.</p>

<p>Then True Steel said, &lsquo;I see, my wife, you have a
clever teacher who has taught you to find out where my
strength lies! I could almost say that your husband is
living, and it is he who teaches you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But she assured him that no one taught her, for she
had no longer any one to do so.</p>

<p>After some days her husband came, and when she told
him she could not learn anything from True Steel, he
said, &lsquo;Try again!&rsquo; and went away.</p>

<p>When True Steel came home she began again to ask
him the secret of his strength. Then he answered her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
&lsquo;Since you think so much of my strength, I will tell you
truly where it is.&rsquo; And he continued, &lsquo;Far away from
this place there is a very high mountain; in the
mountain there is a fox; in the fox there is a heart; in
the heart there is a bird, and in this bird is my strength.
It is no easy task, however, to catch that fox, for she can
transform herself into a multitude of creatures.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Next day, as soon as True Steel left the cave, the
king&rsquo;s son came to his wife, and she told him all she had
learned. Then the prince hurried away to his brothers-in-law,
who waited, all three impatient to see him, and
to hear where was the strength of True Steel. When
they heard, all three went away at once with the prince
to find the mountain. Having got there, they set the
eagles to chase the fox, but the fox ran to a lake, which
was in the midst of the mountain, and changed herself
into a six-winged golden bird. Then the falcons pursued
her, and drove her out of the lake, and she flew into the
clouds, but there the dragons hurried after her. So she
changed herself again into a fox, and began to run along
the earth, but the rest of the eagles stopped her, surrounded,
and caught her.</p>

<p>The three kings then ordered the fox to be killed,
and her heart to be taken out. A great fire was made,
and the bird was taken out of the heart and burnt.
That very moment True Steel fell down dead, and
the prince took his wife and returned home with her.</p>

<h2><a name="chap18" id="chap18"></a>THE SHEPHERD AND THE KING&rsquo;S
DAUGHTER.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG time ago there lived a poor woman who
possessed nothing in the world except one son and
four lambs. The boy took the lambs out to graze every
morning, and brought them home every night. One
day it happened that the lambs were grazing in a field
not far from the summer palace of the king, and the
king&rsquo;s daughter came out to the young shepherd and
asked him to give her one of them. The boy refused,
saying, &lsquo;I cannot give you one, for my mother will
scold me if I do, as we have nothing in the world except
these four lambs.&rsquo; The princess, however, had taken
so great a fancy for a lamb that she would not be refused,
and at last said, &lsquo;Only let me have this one and I
will give you any price you like to ask.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boy, seeing that the princess would not go away
without a lamb, considered a little how he could get
rid of her, and then he told her that he would give her
one if she would show him one of her shoulders. To his
great surprise the princess, without any hesitation,
pushed her mantle aside and showed him her bare white
arm, and he noticed that on the shoulder there was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
mark like a star. He was obliged now to give her one
of his lambs, and when he went home in the evening
he told his mother that he had fallen asleep at noon,
and that when he awoke, one of the lambs had vanished,
and he could not find it anywhere.</p>

<p>Then his mother scolded him very much, saying, &lsquo;I
see you will bring me to the beggar&rsquo;s staff with your
carelessness! To-morrow you must take these three
lambs out to graze very early, and look well about for
the lost one. And if you don&rsquo;t find it you had better
never let me set eyes on you again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At dawn the next day the boy took the three lambs
to graze in the same field, and sat down to consider how
he could get back the lamb he had lost. At noon, when
no one was about, the king&rsquo;s daughter came out of the
palace and said to him, &lsquo;Young shepherd, give me
another lamb, and ask what you please in return.&rsquo; But
the boy answered, &lsquo;No! I dare not give you another; I
have suffered enough for the one I gave you yesterday!
So please go and bring me my lamb back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This the princess refused to do, and said, &lsquo;It is quite
useless to speak of such a thing. But tell me, did you
notice anything particular on my shoulder?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The youth answered, &lsquo;Yes, I saw a star!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; exclaimed the princess; &lsquo;for that you can
never pay me enough, and yet you want your lamb
back!&rsquo; So they almost quarrelled, for the king&rsquo;s
daughter persisted in begging him to give her another
lamb, and the young shepherd insisted that she should
bring him the first one back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
At last, seeing there was no end to her begging, the
boy said, &lsquo;Well! I will give you one if you uncover before
me your other shoulder.&rsquo; This the princess did
instantly, and he remarked that she had the mark of a
star on that arm also. In this way he lost a second
lamb; and when the evening came he went home very
sadly, feeling sure his mother would scold him. And
so she did, far more than at the first time, calling him ill
names and threatening to beat him. The boy was
really sorry that he had given way to the princess&rsquo;s
prayers, but he could not help it now. Next day, again,
the princess came to him and begged so hard and so
long for a third lamb that he became impatient, and,
thinking to shame her, said he would give her one if
she showed him her neck. To his great surprise, however,
the king&rsquo;s daughter at once let her mantle fall,
and he saw that she had the mark of a crescent on her
throat. So the poor boy lost a third lamb, and hardly
dared go home to his mother at night with the one lamb
left them. Indeed the poor old woman was so angry
at her son&rsquo;s carelessness in losing one lamb after another
whilst he slept&mdash;for he did not dare to tell her the truth
about the princess&mdash;that she cursed him as &lsquo;a good-for-nothing
who would bring her to beggary.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all his mother&rsquo;s reproaches and
threats the boy could not refuse the princess the next
day when she came out to ask for the fourth lamb.
However, he tried to get her to go away a long time,
and not until quite tired out with her begging, did he
exclaim, &lsquo;Well, I will give you the lamb if you will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
show me your breast!&rsquo; Then the princess pushed her
robe aside, and the boy noticed that she had the mark
of a sun on her bosom.</p>

<p>In this way the young shepherd lost all the four
lambs, and he lived a long time with his mother in great
poverty.</p>

<p>A long, long time afterwards the king sent out a proclamation
that he intended to let his daughter marry,
and would give her to that man who could tell him what
particular birth-marks she had about her. The young
shepherd heard this proclamation, and when he went
home in the evening he said to his mother, &lsquo;Mother, I
intend to go to the king&rsquo;s palace to-morrow, so get me
my best linen ready.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what do <em>you</em> want in the king&rsquo;s palace?&rsquo; asked
the poor old woman wondering.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I intend, God helping me, to marry the king&rsquo;s
daughter,&rsquo; replied the young man boldly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! you had better give up that fancy,&rsquo; cried the
mother. &lsquo;It will be better for you to go and work and
gain a piaster than to go, like a fly without a head,
dreaming about things that are as high as the sky above
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the young man would not be persuaded, and went
the next day to the king&rsquo;s palace. Before going out of
the hut, however, he said to his anxious old mother,
&lsquo;Good-bye, mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had not walked very far before a gipsy met him,
and asked, &lsquo;Where are you going, my young man?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am going to the king&rsquo;s palace,&rsquo; answered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
youth, &lsquo;and I mean, God helping me, to marry the
king&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But, my dear comrade,&rsquo; said the gipsy, keeping near
him, &lsquo;how can you really expect that she will marry
you, when you are so poor? Only a shepherd!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Eh!&rsquo; returned the young man; &lsquo;but I know what
birth-marks she has, and the king has sent out a proclamation
that whoever guesses these shall have her for
his wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it is so,&rsquo; rejoined the cunning gipsy, &lsquo;I myself will
also go to the palace with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man was glad to have company on the
road, and so he and the gipsy travelled on together
until they came to the residence of the king.</p>

<p>When they came to the palace they found a large
number of people who had come to &lsquo;try their luck,&rsquo;
and guess what birth-marks the princess had. But it
was lost time, for every one of them, after going past
the king and guessing &lsquo;by good luck&rsquo; at the marks of
the princess, was obliged to go away, having lost his
time and gained nothing. At length the turn came for
the young shepherd to pass before the king, and the
gipsy kept close to him to hear what he would say.</p>

<p>So the youth stepped before the king and said, &lsquo;The
princess has a star on each shoulder, and a crescent on
the throat&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the gipsy shouted loudly, &lsquo;Look
there! that is just what I was going to say!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Be quiet!&rsquo; said the young shepherd; &lsquo;or, if you
really know what other marks she has, speak out.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; cried the gipsy, &lsquo;go on, go on! When <em>you</em>
have done, <em>I</em> will speak what I know!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the youth turned again to the king and continued,
&lsquo;The princess has the mark of a sun on her
bosom&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That is exactly what I was going to say!&rsquo; cried the
gipsy, coming up quickly; &lsquo;she has the mark of a sun
on her breast.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the king was exceeding surprised, and confessed
to his counsellors that the young shepherd had really
guessed the truth. But as neither the king nor the
counsellors at all liked the idea of the princess marrying
a poor shepherd, they consulted how they could get rid
of him without giving the lie to the king&rsquo;s proclamation.
At length it was decided that his Majesty should say,
&lsquo;As both the shepherd and the gipsy have guessed the
princess&rsquo;s birth-marks, I cannot justly decide which of
them should marry her. But I will give to each of
them seventy piasters, and they must both go and trade
with this money for a year. At the end of the year,
that one which brings back the most money shall have
the princess for his wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young shepherd and the gipsy, having received
the money, went off in opposite directions to seek their
fortunes.</p>

<p>After having travelled about some time, like a fly
without a head, not knowing where&mdash;the shepherd
stopped one night to rest in the hut of an old woman,
who was even poorer than his own mother.</p>

<p>As he sat with the old woman in the hut that evening,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
the lad thought he might just as well ask her advice as
to the best way to invest his capital of seventy piasters,
so he said: &lsquo;I have seventy piasters to trade with, can
you tell me some good way in which I may employ them
profitably?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old woman considered the matter for some time
before she answered, and then said, &lsquo;To-morrow is
market-day in the next city; go there yourself, and
when a man brings a very poor cow for sale, go up and
try to buy it. The cow will be of many different
colours, but very thin and ill fed, but you must
buy her at whatever price the man asks for her.
When you have bought her, bring her here at
once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man agreed to follow the old woman&rsquo;s
counsel, and so next day he went to the city and really
found there a man who had brought a poor, but variously
coloured, cow to sell. Many people wished to buy
the cow, but the young man outbid them all, and at
length offered all his seventy piasters for her. So he
got the cow, and drove it to the hut where he had passed
the night. When the old woman came out to see who
was coming, he called out to her, &lsquo;Now, my old mother,
I have bought the cow, and what shall we do with her?
She has cost me all my capital!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old woman answered at once, &lsquo;Kill the cow, my
son, and cut it in pieces.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But how will that bring me back my money with
profit?&rsquo; asked the young shepherd, hesitating whether
he should follow her advice or no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my son, but do as I say,&rsquo; returned
the old woman. Accordingly he did as she advised him,
killed the cow and cut her into pieces. This done, he
asked again, &lsquo;And now, what shall I do?&rsquo; The old
woman said quietly, &lsquo;Well, now we will eat the meat,
and the suet we will melt down and put into a pot to
keep for some other occasion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The shepherd did not at all like this proposal, for he
could not see what return he could hope to get for such
an investment of his capital. However, he thought
within himself, &lsquo;Well, since I have been foolish enough
to follow her counsel on the two former occasions, I may
as well follow it also this third time.&rsquo; So he remained
with the old woman many days, until the last piece of
meat had been eaten up. When, however, he thought
over all that had happened, he grew very sad, and, seeing
no sign of anything better, said one morning to the
old woman reproachfully, &lsquo;Now you see by following
your counsel I have spent all the king&rsquo;s money, and am
now a ruined man!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my son,&rsquo; said the old woman; &lsquo;you
can now take that pot of suet with you and go to the
black world, where all the people are black as chimney-pots,
and there you can sell for a good deal of money
your suet, for it has the power to make the black skin
white.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor shepherd was very glad at hearing this, and
next morning took the pot of suet on his shoulder and
started on his journey. After he had travelled many,
many days, he came to a strange-looking country, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
going a little farther, he saw a man who was quite black,
just as the old woman had said&mdash;as black as a chimney-pot.
He was immediately going to offer to sell some of
his fat to the black man, when the latter, frightened at
the sight of a white man, ran away. Many other black
men who saw him did the same, but after a while, when
they saw that he went on quietly carrying his pot on his
shoulder, they took courage, and came to him one by
one, until at last quite a large crowd had gathered about
him. At length, one of them ventured to say to him,
&lsquo;You strange-looking man, tell us who you are, and
where you come from, and why did you come here?&rsquo;
The shepherd answered, &lsquo;I am a white man from a white
world, and I come to bring you some fat which will
make you also white&mdash;that is, of course, if you choose to
buy it from me and pay me for it well.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the black men, though they had been quite
shocked at first to see the white man, began to think
they also would like to be white; so they said they were
willing to pay him as much as he liked to ask for his
wonderful fat, because they were very rich.</p>

<p>However, they doubted a little if the fat would really
make them white as he said, and wished to see it tried
before they bought it. Thereupon he set the pot on the
ground, and walked round and round it, saying some
queer words as if he were charming it. Then he took
out of the pot a little of the fat, and with it smeared
one of the black men. In a moment the black skin
became quite white, and the other blacks, seeing that
he had told them the truth, crowded eagerly round him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
begging that he would make them white also, and outbidding
each other in offers of money, provided only that
he made them white in a short time. The young shepherd
worked hard, smearing one black skin after the
other, until he got quite weary and had become very
rich, for they gave him a good deal of money, and there
were a great many of them who wished to be made white.</p>

<p>Just as he had thus whitened the last of the black
men about him, one of them said to him, &lsquo;Wonder-working
man! We have a king who, being our chief,
is the blackest of us all; therefore, if you think you
can make him white also, we are sure he will be very
glad to get rid of his blackness, and will pay you more
money than you ever dreamt of.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will do it very gladly,&rsquo; answered the shepherd;
&lsquo;for you must know I am doing this not so much for
the sake of money as for charity; only, show me at once
the way to your king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they all ran off before him to show him the way,
and he followed them carrying his pot on his shoulder.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the door of the king&rsquo;s palace,
one of the men said to him, &lsquo;Wait a moment here,
whilst I go and tell his Majesty all about your wonderful
fat, and ask him to receive you.&rsquo; The shepherd waited
quietly, though crowds gathered round him to stare at
him and his great pot, until the man came back and said
the king was waiting impatiently to see him. So he
lifted his pot again on his shoulder&mdash;for he had set it
down that he might rest the better&mdash;and followed the
messenger to the king&rsquo;s presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
Now the king of the black men was far blacker than
anything the shepherd had ever seen in his life; he had
no doubt, however, after all he had seen, but that his
fat would whiten him also. So he said cheerfully, &lsquo;Good
morning, your Majesty!&rsquo; &lsquo;Good morning, my dear
fellow,&rsquo; returned the black king; &lsquo;I have heard that
you can do wonders, and I have seen that you have
already whitened many of my subjects, so, for Heaven&rsquo;s
sake, deliver me also from this my blackness, and ask
in return whatever you like, even the half of my
kingdom!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What your Majesty has heard is quite true,&rsquo; said
the shepherd; &lsquo;and I will very gladly try to make you
also white!&rsquo; and he took a great lump of fat and rubbed
it well all over the king&rsquo;s face and neck. In a moment
the king became as white as snow, to the great rejoicings
of all his people. But no one was so pleased as the
king himself, so he said again, &lsquo;Only ask! I will give
you whatever you wish, even if it be my throne!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I thank your Majesty very humbly for offering me
your throne, but I don&rsquo;t want it,&rsquo; replied the shepherd;
&lsquo;but if you will give me three ships full of gold and
silver, and some good sailors to manage the ships, and
some good soldiers and cannons to defend them against
the pirates, I shall think myself more than repaid, and
I will send you back the ships and cannons when the
gold and silver are landed safely in my country.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king at once gave the necessary orders, and
in a very few days his servants came to report to him,
that the ships were then filled with gold and silver, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
that the cannons were ready loaded and posted for action,
and all the sailors and soldiers prepared to fight if any
sea-robber came in their way.</p>

<p>Then the young shepherd took a courteous leave of the
king, and of all those other people who were so thankful
to him for having changed them from black men into
white ones. He now went on board one of the ships,
very glad to go back to his own country, and the two
other ships full of gold and silver followed the first one
across the seas.</p>

<p>After having sailed a long time the three ships
reached at last the coast of the kingdom where the king
was waiting, daily expecting the return of the gipsy and
shepherd to claim his daughter. The shepherd let his
ships lay quietly in the harbour one day, and then,
noticing much tumult and disturbance in the city, went
ashore to see what had happened. There he found a
great crowd, and on asking some of the people what they
were going to do, they told him that they were going to
hang a gipsy who had come to the city with seventy
piasters capital, and who had not only spent all his
money in drinking and revellings, but had even got into
debt for seventy other piasters, which he was quite
unable to pay, and that this was the reason they were
about to hang him. In a few moments the hangman
appeared, leading the gipsy, who was no other than the
very man who had tried to cheat the shepherd out of
the princess.</p>

<p>The young shepherd recognised his rival at once, and,
going near him, said, &lsquo;What is this, my old friend?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
Have you really come to this?&rsquo; The instant the gipsy
saw the shepherd he stopped and began to whine and
wail, begging him to save him from the gibbet, and he
would be his faithful servant all his life. &lsquo;As for the
princess,&rsquo; he added cunningly, &lsquo;I have given her up a
long time ago, and don&rsquo;t care for anything if only my
life is spared.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the young shepherd was sorry for the poor
trembling, whining wretch, and offered to pay the debt
for the gipsy if the people would let him off. So they
agreed to this, and the young man not only paid the
seventy piasters the gipsy owed, but bought him besides
a suit of good clothes as well as a carriage and a pair of
fine horses. Then he left him and went back to his
ships, and they sailed on slowly along the coast towards
the king&rsquo;s residence.</p>

<p>Now when the gipsy had dressed himself out smartly
in his fine new clothes, he got into his carriage and
drove off quickly to the king&rsquo;s palace. Arrived there,
he left his carriage and horses in the courtyard, and
went at once to the presence of the king, whom he
addressed thus: &lsquo;Your Majesty knows it is not yet quite
a year since you gave me seventy piasters to trade with,
and see! I come back already handsomely dressed, and
have a fine carriage with a pair of beautiful horses below
in the yard. As for the young shepherd, I have heard
that he has not only spent all your Majesty&rsquo;s money in
rioting, but that he had also got in debt, for which he
has been hung. So it is no use waiting for him! Let
us keep my wedding at once!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
The king did not fancy the gipsy for his son-in-law,
and was thinking what he could say to put him off a
little time, when, looking by chance through his
window, he saw three strange-looking ships sailing
slowly towards the shore. At this he exclaimed, &lsquo;I see
some foreign visitors are coming to visit me, and I shall
have enough to do to receive them with due honours, so
we must put off the marriage for some days, at least!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the gipsy pressed the king more and more to let
him marry the princess at once; he was even bold
enough to tell his Majesty that he could not wait any
longer, and that the wedding would be all over in an
hour. The king, however, refused to hear anything of
this; so the gipsy, seeing that his plan had failed, went
out from the presence of the king in great anger.</p>

<p>A few hours later the three strange-looking ships
dropped their anchors just opposite the palace, and the
young shepherd, landing, came into the presence of the
king, who was greatly astonished to see him alive, and
still more astonished to hear that in return for his
seventy piasters he had brought three vessels full of gold
and silver.</p>

<p>The king was now very well content to accept him as
his son-in-law, and told him, in the course of conversation,
what the gipsy had said about his having gone in
debt and been hung. Then the young shepherd told his
Majesty how he had found the gipsy, and had saved his
life by paying his debt for him. The king was exceedingly
angry, and ordered his servants to go after the
gipsy and bring him at once into his presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
The servants looked about and around the palace on
all sides, but nowhere could they find any trace of the
gipsy. Then the king commanded that some of them
should go in search of him without delay, and armed
men were speedily scattered over the whole country, so
that at last he was caught, and brought before the king,
who condemned him to be hung for having so shamefully
tried to injure the man who had saved his life and
treated him so generously, and for having, at the same
time, attempted to cheat the king.</p>

<p>The young shepherd spent a few days in the palace,
telling the king all the things he had seen in the black
world, and then, all preparations having been made, he
was married to the princess, with great pomp and
rejoicings.</p>

<p>Then the king with his daughter and son-in-law lived
for a great many years very happily.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap19" id="chap19"></a>ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T happened once upon a time, many years ago, that
a certain king went into his forest to hunt, when
instead of the usual game he caught a wild man. This
wild man the king had taken to his castle, and locked
up, for safety, in a dungeon. This done, he put out a
proclamation that whosoever should dare to set the wild
man free should be put to death.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the dungeon where the
creature was confined was just below the sleeping-room
of the king&rsquo;s youngest son. Now the wild man cried
and groaned incessantly to be set free, and these unceasing
lamentations at length so moved the young
prince that one night he went down and opened the
dungeon door, and let out the prisoner.</p>

<p>Next morning the king and all the courtiers and servants
were exceedingly astonished to hear no longer the
usual sounds of wailing from the dungeon, and the king,
suspecting something amiss, went down himself to see
what had become of his captive. When he found the
den empty he flew into a great passion, and demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
fiercely who had presumed to disobey his commands and
let out the wild man. All the courtiers were so terrified
at the sight of the king&rsquo;s angry countenance, that not
one of them dared speak, not even to assert their innocence.
However, the young prince, the king&rsquo;s son, went
forward at last and confessed that the pitiful crying of
the poor creature had so disturbed him day and night,
that at length he himself had opened the door. When
the king heard this, it was his turn to be sorry, for he
found himself compelled to put his own son to death or
give his own proclamation the lie.</p>

<p>However, some of his old counsellors, seeing how
greatly the king was perplexed and troubled, came and
assured his Majesty that the proclamation would in
reality be carried out if the prince, instead of being put
to death, was simply banished from the kingdom for
ever.</p>

<p>The king was very glad to find this way of getting out
of the dilemma, and so ordered his son to leave the country,
and never come back to it, at the same time he
gave him many letters of recommendation to the king
of a very distant kingdom, and directed one of the court
servants to go with the young prince to wait upon him.
Then the unhappy young prince and his servant started
on their long journey.</p>

<p>After travelling some time, the young prince became
very thirsty, and, seeing a well not far off, went up to
it to drink. However, there happened to be no bucket
at the well, nor anything in which to draw water,
though the well was pretty full. Seeing this, the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
prince said to his servant, &lsquo;Hold me fast by the heels,
and let me down into the pit that I may drink.&rsquo; So
saying, he bent over the well, and the servant let him
down as he was directed.</p>

<p>When the prince had quenched his thirst, and wished
to be pulled back, the servant refused, saying, &lsquo;Now I
can let you fall into the pit in a moment, and I shall do
so unless you consent at once to change clothes and
places with me. I will be the prince henceforth, and
you shall be my servant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king&rsquo;s son, seeing that he had foolishly placed
himself in the power of the servant, promised readily
everything his servant asked, and begged only to be
drawn up.</p>

<p>But the faithless servant, without noticing his
master&rsquo;s prayers, said roughly, &lsquo;You must make a
solemn oath that you will not speak a word to any one
about the change we are going to make.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Of course, since the prince could not help himself,
he took the oath at once, and then the servant drew him
up, and they changed clothes. Then the wicked servant
dressed himself in his master&rsquo;s fine clothes, mounted his
master&rsquo;s horse, and rode forward on the journey, whilst
the unfortunate prince, disguised in his servant&rsquo;s dress,
walked beside him.</p>

<p>In this way they went on until they came to the court
of the king to which the exiled son had been recommended
by his father.</p>

<p>Faithful to his promise, the unfortunate prince saw
his false servant received at the court with great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
honours as the son of a great king, whilst he himself, all
unnoticed, stood in the waiting-room with the servants,
and was treated by them with all familiarity as their
equal.</p>

<p>After having some time enjoyed to his heart&rsquo;s content
the hospitalities the king lavished upon him, the false
servant began to be afraid that his master&rsquo;s patience
might be wearied out soon, under all the indignities to
which he was exposed, and that one day he might be
tempted to forget his oath and proclaim himself in his
true character. Filled with these misgivings, the
wicked man thought over all possible ways by which he
could do away with his betrayed master without any
danger to himself.</p>

<p>One day he thought he had found out a way to do this,
and took the first opportunity to carry out his cruel plan.</p>

<p>Now you must know that the king at whose court this
unhappy prince and the false servant were staying, kept
in his gardens a great number of wild beasts fastened
up in large cages. One morning, as the pretended prince
was walking in these gardens with the king, he said
suddenly, &lsquo;Your Majesty has a large number of very
fine wild beasts, and I admire them very much; I think,
however, it is a pity that you keep them always fastened
up, and spend so much money over their food. Why
not send them under a keeper to find their own food in
the forest? I dare say your Majesty would be very glad
if I recommended a man to you who could take them
out in the morning and bring them back safely at
night?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
The king asked, &lsquo;Do you really think, prince, that
you can find me such a man?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course, I can,&rsquo; replied unhesitatingly the cruel
man; &lsquo;such a man is now in your Majesty&rsquo;s court. I
mean my own servant. Only call him and threaten that
you will have his head cut off if he does not do it, and
compel him to accept the task. I dare say he will try to
excuse himself, and say the thing is impossible, but only
threaten him with the loss of his head whether he refuses
or fails. For my part, I am quite willing your
Majesty should have him put to death, if he disobeys.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the king heard this, he summoned the disguised
prince before him, and said, &lsquo;I hear that you can
do wonders: that you are able to drive wild beasts out
like cattle to find their own food in the forest, and bring
them back safely at night into their cages. Therefore,
I order you this morning to drive all my bears into the
forest, and to bring them back again in the evening. If
you don&rsquo;t do this, your head will pay for it; so beware!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The unlucky prince answered, &lsquo;I am not able to do
this thing, so your Majesty had better cut off my head
at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the king would not listen to him, only saying,
&lsquo;We will wait until evening; <em>then</em> I shall surely have
your head cut off unless you bring back all my bears
safely to their cages.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now nothing was left for the poor prince to do but
open the cage-doors and try his luck in driving the bears
to the forest. The moment he opened the doors all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
bears rushed out wildly, and disappeared quickly among
the trees.</p>

<p>The prince followed them sadly into the forest, and
sat down on a fallen tree to think over his hard fortunes.
As he sat thus, he began to weep bitterly, for he saw no
better prospect before him than to lose his head at night.</p>

<p>As he sat thus crying, a creature in form like a man,
but covered all over with thick hair, came out of a
neighbouring thicket, and asked him what he was crying
for. Then the prince told him all that had happened
to him, and that as all the bears had run away he
expected to be beheaded at night when he returned
without them. Hearing this, the wild man gave him a
little bell, and said kindly, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid! Only
take care of this bell, and when you wish the bears to
return, just ring it gently, and they will all come back
and follow you quietly into their cages.&rsquo; And having
said this he went away.</p>

<p>When the sun began to go down, the prince rang the
little bell gently, and, to his great joy, all the bears
came dancing awkwardly round him, and let him lead
them back to the gardens, following him like a flock of
sheep, whilst he, pleased with his success, took out a
flute and played little airs as he walked before them.
In this way he was able to fasten them up again in their
dens without the least trouble.</p>

<p>Every one at the court was astonished at this, and the
false servant more than all the others, though he concealed
his surprise, and said to the king, &lsquo;Your Majesty
sees now that I told you the truth. I am quite sure the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
man can manage the wolves just as well as the bears, if
you only threaten him as before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon, the next morning the king called the poor
prince, and ordered him to lead out the wolves to find
their food in the forest and to bring them back to their
cages at night. &lsquo;Unless you do this,&rsquo; said his Majesty,
as before, &lsquo;you will lose your head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince pleaded vainly the impossibility of his
doing such a thing; but the king would not hear him,
only saying, &lsquo;You may as well try, for whether you
refuse or fail you will certainly lose your head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the prince was obliged to open the cages of the
wolves, and the moment he did this the wild animals
sprang past him into the thickets just as the bears had
done, and he, following them slowly, went and sat down
to bewail his ill-luck.</p>

<p>Whilst he sat thus weeping, the wild man came out
of the wood and asked him, just as he had done the day
before, what he was crying for. The prince told him,
whereupon the creature gave him another little bell, and
said, &lsquo;When you want the wolves to come back, just
ring this bell, and they will all come and follow you.&rsquo;
Having said this he went back into the wood, and left
the prince alone.</p>

<p>Just before it grew dark, the prince rang his bell, and
to his great joy all the wolves came rushing up to him
from all quarters of the forest, and followed him quietly
back to their cages.</p>

<p>Seeing this, the false servant advised the king to send
out the birds also, and to threaten the disguised prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
with the loss of his head if he failed to bring them also
back in the evening.</p>

<p>Accordingly the next morning the king ordered the
prince to let out all the wild doves, and to bring them
all safely to their different cages before night set in.</p>

<p>The instant the poor young man opened the cage-doors
the wild doves rose like a cloud into the air, and
vanished over the tops of the trees. So the prince went
into the forest and sat down again on the fallen tree.
As he sat there, thinking how hopeless a task he had
now before him, he could not help crying aloud and
bewailing all his past misfortunes and present miserable
fate.</p>

<p>Hardly had he begun to lament, however, before the
same wild man came from the bushes near him and
asked what fresh trouble had befallen him. Then the
prince told him. Thereupon the wild man gave him a
third bell, saying, &lsquo;When you wish the wild doves to
return to their cages you have only to ring this little
bell.&rsquo; And so it indeed happened, for the moment the
prince began ringing softly, all the doves came flying
about him, and he walked back to the palace gardens
and shut them up in their different cages without the
least trouble.</p>

<p>Now, happily for the prince, the king had just at this
time much more important business on his hands than
finding his wild beasts and birds in food without paying
for it. No less a matter, in fact, began to occupy him
than the finding a suitable husband for his daughter.
For this purpose he sent out a proclamation that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
would hold races during three days, and would reward
the victor of each day with a golden apple. Whosoever
should succeed in winning all three apples should have
the young princess for his wife. Now this princess was
far more beautiful than any other princess in the world,
and an exceeding great number of knights prepared to
try and win her. This, the poor prince in his servant&rsquo;s
dress watched with great dismay; for he had fallen
deeply in love with the fair daughter of the king. So
he puzzled himself day and night with plans how he,
too, could try his luck in the great race.</p>

<p>At last he determined to go into the forest and ask
the wild man to help him. When the wild man heard
the prince calling, he came out of the thicket, and
listened to all he had to say about the matter. Seeing
how much the prince was interested in the young princess,
who was to be the prize of the victor, the wild man
brought out some handsome clothes and a fine horse,
and gave them to the prince, saying, &lsquo;When you start
in a race, do not urge your horse too much, but at the
end, when you are getting near the goal, spur him, and
then you will be sure to win. Don&rsquo;t forget, however, to
bring me the golden apple as soon as you receive
it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>All came to pass just as the wild man had said. The
prince won the apples the two first days; but as he disappeared
as soon as he received them from the king, no
one in the court recognised him in his fine attire, and
all wondered greatly who the stranger knight might be.
As for the king, he was more perplexed and curious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
than all the rest, and determined not to let the stranger
escape so easily the third day. So he ordered a deep,
wide ditch to be dug at the end of the race-course, and a
high wall built beyond it, thinking thus to stop the
victor and find out who he was.</p>

<p>The prince, hearing of the king&rsquo;s orders, and guessing
the reason of them, went once again into the forest to
ask help from his wild friend. The wild man, thereupon,
brought out to him a still more beautiful racer,
and a suit of splendid clothes; and, thus prepared, the
prince took his place as before among the knights who
were going to try for the prize. He won the golden
apple this third time also; but, to the surprise of the
king and the whole court, who hoped now to find out
who he was, he made his horse spring lightly over the
ditch, and the great wall, and vanished again in the
forest.</p>

<p>The king tried every way to find out who had won the
three golden apples, but all in vain. At last, one day,
the princess, walking in the gardens of the palace, met
the prince disguised in his servant&rsquo;s dress, and saw the
shining of the three apples which he carried concealed
in his bosom. Thereupon she ran at once to her father,
and told him what she had seen, and the king, wondering
very much, called the servant before him.</p>

<p>Now the prince thought it time to put an end to all
his troubles, and therefore told the king frankly all his
misfortunes. He related how he had offended the king,
his father, and been exiled for life; how his false
servant had betrayed him; and how the wild man he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
had set free had come to help him out of the fearful
snares the wicked servant had spread for him.</p>

<p>After hearing all this, the king very gladly gave him
the princess for wife, and ordered the false servant to be
put to death immediately.</p>

<p>As for the prince, he lived with his beautiful princess
very happily for many years after this, and when the
king, his father-in-law, died, he left to them both the
kingdom.</p>

<h2><a name="chap20" id="chap20"></a>THE BITER BIT.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time there was an old man who, whenever
he heard anyone complain how many sons he
had to care for, always laughed and said, &lsquo;I wish that it
would please God to give me a hundred sons!&rsquo;</p>

<p>This he said in jest; as time, however, went on he
had, in reality, neither more nor less than a hundred
sons.</p>

<p>He had trouble enough to find different trades for his
sons, but when they were once all started in life they
worked diligently and gained plenty of money. Now,
however, came a fresh difficulty. One day the eldest
son came in to his father and said, &lsquo;My dear father, I
think it is quite time that I should marry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he said these words before the second son
came in, saying, &lsquo;Dear father, I think it is already time
that you were looking out for a wife for me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A moment later came in the third son, asking, &lsquo;Dear
father, don&rsquo;t you think it is high time that you should
find me a wife?&rsquo; In like manner came the fourth and
fifth, until the whole hundred had made a similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
request. All of them wished to marry, and desired
their father to find wives for them as soon as he
could.</p>

<p>The old man was not a little troubled at these
requests; he said, however, to his sons, &lsquo;Very well, my
sons, <em>I</em> have nothing to say against your marrying;
there is, however, I foresee, one great difficulty in the
way. There are one hundred of you asking for wives,
and I hardly think we can find one hundred marriageable
girls in all the fifteen villages which are in our
neighbourhood.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To this the sons, however, answered, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
anxious about that, but mount your horse and take in
your sack sufficient engagement-cakes. You must take,
also, a stick in your hand so that you can cut a notch in
it for every girl you see. It does not signify whether
she be handsome or ugly, or lame or blind, just cut a
notch in your stick for every one you meet with.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man said, &lsquo;Very wisely spoken, my sons! I
will do exactly as you tell me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly he mounted his horse, took a sack full
of cakes on his shoulder and a long stick in his hand,
and started off at once to beat up the neighbourhood
for girls to marry his sons.</p>

<p>The old man had travelled from village to village
during a whole month, and whenever he had seen a
girl he cut a notch in his stick. But he was getting
pretty well tired, and he began to count how many
notches he had already made. When he had counted
them carefully over and over again, to be certain that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
he had counted all, he could only make out seventy-four,
so that still twenty-six were wanting to complete the
number required. He was, however, so weary with his
month&rsquo;s ride, that he determined to return home. As
he rode along, he saw a priest driving oxen yoked to a
plough, and seemingly very deep in anxious thought
about something. Now the old man wondered a little
to see the priest ploughing his own corn-fields without
even a boy to help him, he therefore shouted to ask him
why he drove his oxen himself. The priest, however,
did not even turn his head to see who called to him, so
intent was he in urging on his oxen and in guiding his
plough.</p>

<p>The old man thought he had not spoken loud enough,
so he shouted out again as loud as he could, &lsquo;Stop your
oxen a little, and tell me why you are ploughing yourself
without even a lad to help you, and this, too, on a holy-day?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now the priest&mdash;who was in a perspiration with his
hard work&mdash;answered testily, &lsquo;I conjure you by your old
age, leave me in peace! I cannot tell you my ill-luck.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this answer, however, the old man was only the
more curious, and persisted all the more earnestly in
asking questions to find out why the priest ploughed on
a Saint&rsquo;s day. At last the priest, tired with his importunity,
sighed deeply and said, &lsquo;Well, if you <em>will</em> know:
I am the only man in my household, and God has
blessed me with a hundred daughters!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man was overjoyed at hearing this, and exclaimed
cheerfully, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very good! It is just what I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
want, for <em>I</em> have a hundred sons, and so, as you have a
hundred daughters, we can be friends!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The moment the priest heard this he became pleasant
and talkative, and invited the old man to pass the night
in his house. Then, leaving his plough in the field, he
drove the oxen back to the village. Just before reaching
his house, however, he said to the old man, &lsquo;Go
yourself into the house whilst I tie up my oxen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had the old man entered the yard
than the wife of the priest rushed at him with a big
stick, crying out, &lsquo;We have not bread enough for our
hundred daughters, and we want neither beggars nor
visitors,&rsquo; and with these words she drove him away.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the priest came out of the barn,
and, finding the old man sitting on the road before the
gate, asked him why he had not gone into the house as
he had told him to do. Whereupon the old man replied,
&lsquo;I went in, but your wife drove me away!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the priest said, &lsquo;Only wait here a moment till I
come back to fetch you.&rsquo; He then went quickly into his
house and scolded his wife right well, saying, &lsquo;What
have you done? What a fine chance you have spoiled!
The man who came in was going to be our friend, for
he has a hundred sons who would gladly have married
our hundred daughters!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the wife heard this she changed her dress
hastily, and arranged her hair and head-dress in a different
fashion. Then she smiled very sweetly, and welcomed
with the greatest possible politeness the old man,
when her husband led him into the house. In fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
she pretended that she knew nothing at all of any one
having been driven away from their door. And as the
old man wanted much to find wives for his sons, he also
pretended that he did not know that the smiling house-mistress
and the woman who drove him away with a
stick were one and the self-same person.</p>

<p>So the old man passed the night in the house, and
next morning asked the priest formally to give him his
hundred daughters for wives for his hundred sons.
Thereupon the priest answered that he was quite willing,
and had already spoken to his daughters about the
matter, and that they, too, were all quite willing. Then
the old man took out his &lsquo;engagement-cakes,&rsquo; and
put them on the table beside him, and gave each of
the girls a piece of money to <i>mark</i> them. Then each
of the engaged girls sent a small present by him to that
one of his sons to whom she was thus betrothed. These
gifts the old man put in the bag wherein he had carried
the &lsquo;engagement-cakes.&rsquo; He then mounted his horse,
and rode off merrily homewards.</p>

<p>There were great rejoicings in his household when he
told how successful he had been in his search, and that
he really had found a hundred girls ready and willing
to be married; and these hundred, too, a priest&rsquo;s
daughters.</p>

<p>The sons insisted that they should begin to make the
wedding preparations without delay and commenced
at once to invite the guests who were to form part of
the wedding procession to go to the priest&rsquo;s house and
bring home the brides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>196]</a></span>
Here, however, another difficulty occurred. The old
father must find two hundred <i>brideleaders</i> (two for each
bride); one hundred <i>kooms</i> (first witnesses); one
hundred <i>starisvats</i> (second witnesses); one hundred
<i>chaious</i> (running footmen who go before the processions)
and three hundred <i>vojvodes</i> (standard-bearers);
and, besides these, a respectable number of other non-official
guests.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To find all these persons the father had to hunt
throughout the neighbourhood for three years; at last,
however, they were all found, and a day was appointed
when they were to meet at his house and go thence in
procession to the house of the priest.</p>

<p>On the appointed day all the invited guests gathered
at the old man&rsquo;s house. With great noise and confusion,
after a fair amount of feasting, the wedding procession
was formed properly, and set out for the house
of the priest where the hundred brides were already
prepared for their departure for their new home.</p>

<p>So great was the confusion, indeed, that the old man
quite forgot to take with him one of the hundred sons,
and never missed him in the greeting and talking and
drinking he was obliged, as father of the bridegrooms,
to go through. Now the young man had worked so
long and so hard in preparing for the wedding-day that
he never woke up till long after the procession had
started and every one had had, like his father, too much
to do and too many things to think of to miss him.</p>

<p>The wedding procession arrived in good order at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
priest&rsquo;s house, where a feast was already spread out for
them. Having done honour to the various good things,
and having gone through all the ceremonies usual on
such occasions, the hundred brides were given over to
their &lsquo;leaders,&rsquo; and the procession started on its return
to the old man&rsquo;s house. But, as they did not set off
until pretty late in the afternoon, it was decided that the
night should be spent somewhere on the road. When
they came, therefore, to a certain river named &lsquo;Luckless,&rsquo;
as it was already dark, some of the men proposed
that the party should pass the night by the side of the
water without crossing over. However, some others of
the chief of the party so warmly advised the crossing
the river and encamping on the other bank, that this
course was at length, after a very lively discussion,
determined on; accordingly the procession began to
move over the bridge.</p>

<p>Just, however, as the wedding party were half-way
across the bridge its two sides began to draw nearer each
other, and pressed the people so close together that they
had hardly room to breathe&mdash;much less could they move
forwards or backwards.</p>

<p>They were kept for some time in this position, some
shouting and scolding, others quiet because frightened,
until at length a black giant appeared, and shouted to
them in a terribly loud voice, &lsquo;Who are you all? Where
do you come from? Where are you going?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Some of the bolder among them answered, &lsquo;We are
going to our old friend&rsquo;s house, taking home the
hundred brides for his hundred sons; but unluckily we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
ventured on this bridge after nightfall, and it has
pressed us so tightly together that we cannot move one
way or the other.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And where is your old friend?&rsquo; inquired the black giant.</p>

<p>Now all the wedding guests turned their eyes towards
the old man. Thereupon he turned towards the giant,
who instantly said to him, &lsquo;Listen, old man! Will you
give me what you have forgotten at home, if I let your
friends pass over the bridge?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man considered some time what it might be
that he had forgotten at home, but, at last, not being
able to recollect anything in particular that he had left,
and hearing on all sides the groans and moans of his
guests, he replied, &lsquo;Well, I will give it you, if you will
only let the procession pass over.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the black giant said to the party, &lsquo;You all hear
what he has promised, and are all my witnesses to the
bargain. In three days I shall come to fetch what I
have bargained for.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Having said this, the black giant widened the bridge
and the whole procession passed on to the other bank
in safety. The people, however, no longer wished to
spend the night on the way, so they moved on as fast
as they could, and early in the morning reached the old
man&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>As everybody talked of the strange adventure they
had met with, the eldest son, who had been left at home,
soon began to understand how the matter stood, and
went to his father saying, &lsquo;O my father! you have sold
<em>me</em> to the black giant!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
Then the old man was very sorry, and troubled;
but his friends comforted him, saying, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
frightened! nothing will come of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The marriage ceremonies were celebrated with
great rejoicings. Just, however, as the festivities were
at their height, on the third day, the black giant appeared
at the gate and shouted, &lsquo;Now, give me at once
what you have promised.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man, trembling all over, went forward and
asked him, &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing but what you have promised me!&rsquo; returned
the black giant.</p>

<p>As he could not break his promise, the old man, very
much distressed, was then obliged to deliver up his
eldest son to the giant, who thereupon said, &lsquo;Now I
shall take your son with me, but after three years have
passed you can come to the Luckless River and take him
away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Having said this the black giant disappeared, taking
with him the young man, whom he carried off to his
workshop as an apprentice to the trade of witchcraft.</p>

<p>From that time the poor old man had not a single
moment of happiness. He was always sad and anxious,
and counted every year, and month, and week, and even
every day, until the dawn of the last day of the three
years. Then he took a staff in his hand and hurried
off to the bank of the river Luckless. As soon as he
reached the river, he was met by the black giant, who
asked him, &lsquo;Why are you come?&rsquo; The old man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
answered that he had come to take home his son, according
to his agreement.</p>

<p>Thereupon the giant brought out a tray on which
stood a sparrow, a turtle-dove, and a quail, and said
to the old man, &lsquo;Now, if you can tell which of these is
your son, you may take him away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor old father looked intently at the three birds,
one after the other, and over and over again, but at last
he was forced to own that he could not tell which of
them was his son. So he was obliged to go away by
himself, and was far more miserable than before. He
had hardly, however, got half-way home when he
thought he would go back to the river and take one of
the birds which he remembered had looked at him intently.</p>

<p>When he reached the river Luckless he was again
met by the black giant, who brought out the tray again,
and placed on it this time a partridge, a tit-mouse, and a
thrush, saying, &lsquo;Now, my old man, find out which is
your son!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The anxious father again looked at one bird after the
other, but he felt more uncertain than before, and so,
crying bitterly, again went away.</p>

<p>Just as the old man was going through a forest, which
was between the river Luckless and his house, an old
woman met him, and said, &lsquo;Stop a moment! Where
are you hurrying to? And why are you in such
trouble?&rsquo; Now, the old man was so deeply musing over
his great unhappiness that he did not at first attend to
the old woman; but she followed him, calling after him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
and repeating her questions with more earnestness. So
he stopped at last, and told her what a terrible misfortune
had fallen upon him. When the old woman had
listened to the whole story, she said cheerfully, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
be cast down! Don&rsquo;t be afraid! Go back again to the
river, and, when the giant brings out the three birds,
look into their eyes sharply. When you see that one of
the birds has a tear in one of its eyes, seize that bird
and hold it fast, for it has a human soul.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old man thanked her heartily for her advice, and
turned back, for the third time, towards the Luckless
River. Again the black giant appeared, and looked
very merry whilst he brought out his tray and put upon
it a sparrow, a dove, and a woodpecker, saying, &lsquo;My old
man! find out which is your son!&rsquo; Then the father
looked sharply into the eyes of the birds, and saw that
from the right eye of the dove a tear dropped slowly
down. In a moment he grasped the bird tightly, saying,
&lsquo;This is my son!&rsquo; The next moment he found
himself holding fast his eldest son by the shoulder, and
so, singing and shouting in his great joy, took him
quickly home, and gave him over to his eldest daughter-in-law,
the wife of his son.</p>

<p>Now, for some time they all lived together very
happily. One day, however, the young man said to
his father, &lsquo;Whilst I was apprentice in the workshop
of the black giant, I learned a great many tricks of
witchcraft. Now I intend to change myself into a fine
horse, and you shall take me to market and sell me for a
good sum of money. But be sure not to give up the halter.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
The father did as the son had said. Next market-day
he went to the city with a fine horse which he
offered for sale. Many buyers came round him, admiring
the horse, and bidding large sums for it, so that
at last the old man was able to sell it for two thousand
ducats. When he received the money, he took good
care not to let go the halter, and he returned home far
richer than he ever dreamt of being.</p>

<p>A few days later, the man who had bought the horse
sent his servant with it to the river to bathe, and, whilst
in the water, the horse got loose from the servant and
galloped off into the neighbouring forest. There he
changed himself back into his real shape, and returned
to his father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>After some time had passed, the young man said one
day to his father, &lsquo;Now I will change myself into an
ox, and you can take me to market to sell me; but
take care not to give up the rope with which you lead
me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So next market-day the old man went to the city leading
a very fine ox, and soon found a buyer, who offered
him ten times the usual price paid for an ox. The
buyer asked also for the rope to lead the animal home,
but the old man said, &lsquo;What do you want with such an
old thing? You had better buy a new one!&rsquo; and he
went off taking with him the rope.</p>

<p>That evening, whilst the servants of the buyer were
driving the ox to the field, he ran away into a wood
near, and, having taken there his human shape, returned
home to his father&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
On the eve of the next market-day, the young man
said to his father, &lsquo;Now I will change myself into a
cow with golden horns, and you can sell me as before,
only take care not to give up the string.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly he changed himself next morning into a
cow, and the old man took it to the market-place, and
asked for it three hundred crowns.</p>

<p>But the black giant had learnt that his former apprentice
was making a great deal of money by practising
the trade he had taught him, and, being jealous at
this, he determined to put an end to the young man&rsquo;s
gains.</p>

<p>Therefore, on the third day he came to the market
himself as a buyer, and the moment he saw the beautiful
cow with golden horns he knew that it could be no
other than his former apprentice. So he came up to
the old man, and, having outbid all the other would-be
purchasers, paid at once the price he had agreed on.
Having done this, he caught the string in his hand,
and tried to wrench it from the terrified old man, who
called out, &lsquo;I have not sold you the string, but the
cow!&rsquo; and held the string as fast as he could with both
hands.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said the buyer, &lsquo;I have the law and custom
on my side! Whoever buys a cow, buys also the string
with which it is led!&rsquo; Some of the amused and astonished
lookers-on said that this was quite true, therefore
the old man was obliged to give up the string.</p>

<p>The black giant, well satisfied with his purchase, took
the cow with him to his castle, and, after having put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
iron chains on her legs, fastened her in a cellar. Every
morning the giant gave the cow some water and hay,
but he never unchained her.</p>

<p>One evening, however, the cow, with incessant
struggles, managed to get free from the chains, and
immediately opened the cellar-door with her horns and
ran away.</p>

<p>Next morning the black giant went as usual into the
cellar, carrying the hay and water for the cow; but
seeing she had got free and run away, he threw the hay
down, and started off at once to pursue her.</p>

<p>When he came within sight of her, he turned himself
into a wolf and ran at her with great fury; but his
clever apprentice changed himself instantly from a cow
into a bear, whereupon the giant turned himself from a
wolf into a lion; the bear then turned into a tiger, and
the lion changed into a crocodile, whereupon the tiger
turned into a sparrow. Upon this the giant changed
from the form of a crocodile into a hawk, and the apprentice
immediately changed into a hare; on seeing
which, the hawk became a greyhound. Then the apprentice
changed from a hare into a falcon, and the
greyhound into an eagle; whereupon the apprentice
changed into a fish. The giant then turned from an
eagle into a mouse, and immediately the apprentice, as
a cat, ran after him; then the giant turned himself
into a heap of millet, and the apprentice transformed
himself into a hen and chickens, which very greedily
picked up all the millet except one single seed, in which
the master was, who changed himself into a squirrel;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
instantly, however, the apprentice became a hawk, and,
pouncing on the squirrel, killed it.</p>

<p>In this way the apprentice beat his master, the black
giant, and revenged himself for all the sufferings he
had endured whilst learning the trade of witchcraft.
Having killed the squirrel, the hawk took his proper
shape again, and the young man returned joyfully to
his father, whom he made immensely rich.</p>

<h2><a name="chap21" id="chap21"></a>THE TRADE THAT NO ONE KNOWS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> LONG while ago there lived a poor old couple, who
had an only son. The old man and his wife
worked very hard to nourish their child well and bring
him up properly, hoping that he, in return, would take
care of them in their old age.</p>

<p>When, however, the boy had grown up, he said to his
parents, &lsquo;I am a man now, and I intend to marry, so I
wish you to go at once to the king and ask him to give
me his daughter for wife.&rsquo; The astonished parents
rebuked him, saying, &lsquo;What can you be thinking of?
We have only this poor hut to shelter us, and hardly
bread enough to eat, and we dare not presume to go into
the king&rsquo;s presence, much less can we venture to ask for
his daughter to be your wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The son, however, insisted that they should do as he
said, threatening that if they did not comply with his
wishes he would leave them, and go away into the world.
Seeing that he was really in earnest in what he said,
the unhappy parents promised him they would go and
ask for the king&rsquo;s daughter. Then the old mother made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
a wedding cake in her son&rsquo;s presence, and, when it was
ready, she put it in a bag, took her staff in her hand,
and went straight to the palace where the king lived.
There the king&rsquo;s servants bade her come in, and led her
into the hall where his Majesty was accustomed to
receive the poor people who came to ask alms or to
present petitions.</p>

<p>The poor old woman stood in the hall, confused and
ashamed at her worn-out, shabby clothes, and looking as
if she were made of stone, until the king said to her
kindly, &lsquo;What do <em>you</em> want from me, old mother?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She dared not, however, tell his Majesty why she had
come, so she stammered out in her confusion, &lsquo;Nothing,
your Majesty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the king smiled a little and said, &lsquo;Perhaps you
come to ask alms?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the old woman, much abashed, replied, &lsquo;Yes,
your Majesty, if you please!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the king called his servants and ordered
them to give the old woman ten crowns, which they did.
Having received this money, she thanked his Majesty,
and returned home, saying to herself, &lsquo;I dare say when
my son sees all this money he will not think any more
of going away from us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In this thought, however, she was quite mistaken, for
no sooner had she entered the hut than the son came to
her and asked impatiently, &lsquo;Well, mother, have you
done as I asked you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this she exclaimed, &lsquo;Do give up, once for all, this
silly fancy, my son. How could you expect me to ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
the king for his daughter to be your wife? That would
be a bold thing for a rich nobleman to do, how then
can <em>we</em> think of such a thing? Anyhow, <em>I</em> dared not
say one word to the king about it. But only look
what a lot of money I have brought back. Now you
can look for a wife suitable for you, and then you will
forget the king&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the young man heard his mother speak thus,
he grew very angry, and said to her, &lsquo;What do I want
with the king&rsquo;s money? I don&rsquo;t want his money, but I
<em>do</em> want his daughter! I see you are only playing with
me, so I shall leave you. I will go away somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;wherever
my eyes lead me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the poor old parents prayed and begged him not
to go away from them, and leave them alone in their
old age; but they could only quiet him by promising
faithfully that the mother should go again next day to
the king, and this time really ask him to give his
daughter to her son for a wife.</p>

<p>In the morning, therefore, the old woman went again
to the palace, and the servants showed her into the same
hall she had been in before. The king, seeing her stand
there, inquired, &lsquo;What want you, my old woman, now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She was, however, so ashamed that she could hardly
stammer, &lsquo;Nothing, please your Majesty.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king, supposing that she came again to beg,
ordered his servants to give her this time also ten
crowns.</p>

<p>With this money the poor woman returned to her hut,
where her son met her, asking, &lsquo;Well, mother, <em>this</em> time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
I hope you have done what I asked you?&rsquo; But she
replied, &lsquo;Now, my dear son, do leave the king&rsquo;s daughter
in peace. How can you really think of such a thing?
Even if she would marry you, where is the house to
bring her to? So be quiet, and take this money which
I have brought you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At these words the son was more angry than before,
and said sharply, &lsquo;As I see you will not let me marry
the king&rsquo;s daughter, I will leave you this moment and
never come back again;&rsquo; and, rushing out of the hut,
he ran away. His parents hurried after him, and at
length prevailed on him to return, by swearing to him
that his mother should go again to the king next
morning, and really and in truth ask his Majesty this
time for his daughter.</p>

<p>So the young man agreed to go back home and wait
until the next day.</p>

<p>On the morrow the old woman, with a heavy heart,
went to the palace, and was shown as before into the
king&rsquo;s presence. Seeing her there for the third time,
his Majesty asked her impatiently, &lsquo;What do you want
this time, old woman?&rsquo; And she, trembling all over,
said, &lsquo;Please your Majesty&mdash;nothing.&rsquo; Then the king
exclaimed, &lsquo;But it cannot be nothing. Something you
must want, so tell me the truth at once, if you value
your life!&rsquo; Thereupon the old woman was forced to
tell all the story to the king; how her son had a great
desire to marry the princess, and so had forced her to
come and ask the king to give her to him for wife.</p>

<p>When the king had heard everything, he said, &lsquo;Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
after all, <em>I</em> shall say nothing against it if my daughter
will consent to it.&rsquo; He then told his servants to lead the
princess into his presence. When she came he told her
all about the affair, and asked her, &lsquo;Are you willing to
marry the son of this old woman?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The princess answered, &lsquo;Why not? If only he learns
first the trade that no one knows!&rsquo; Thereupon the
king bade his attendants give money to the poor woman,
who now went back to her hut with a light heart.</p>

<p>The moment she entered, her son asked her, &lsquo;Have
you engaged her?&rsquo; And she returned, &lsquo;Do let me get
my breath a little! Well, <em>now</em> I have really asked the
king; but it is of no use, for the princess declares she
will not marry you until you have learnt the trade that
no one knows!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, that matters nothing!&rsquo; exclaimed the son.
&lsquo;Now I only know the condition, it&rsquo;s all right!&rsquo; The
next morning the young man set out on his travels
through the world in search of a man who could teach
him the trade that no one knows. He wandered about
a long time without being able to find out where he
could learn such a trade. At length one day, being
quite tired out with walking and very sad, he sat down
on a fallen log by the wayside. After he had sat thus
a little while, an old woman came up to him, and asked,
&lsquo;Why art thou so sad, my son?&rsquo; And he answered,
&lsquo;What is the use of your asking, when you cannot help
me?&rsquo; But she continued, &lsquo;Only tell me what is the
matter, and perhaps I can help you.&rsquo; Then he said,
&lsquo;Well, if you must know, the matter is this: I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
been travelling about the world a long time to find a
master who can teach me the trade which no one knows.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Oh, if it is only that,&rsquo; cried the old woman, &lsquo;just listen
to me! Don&rsquo;t be afraid, but go straight into the forest
which lies before you, and there you will find what you
want.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The young man was very glad to hear this, and got
up at once and went to the forest. When he had gone
pretty far in the wood, he saw a large castle, and, whilst
he stood looking at it and wondering what it was, four
giants came out of it and ran up to him, shouting, &lsquo;Do
you wish to learn the trade that no one knows?&rsquo; He
said, &lsquo;Yes; that is just the reason why I come here.&rsquo;
Whereupon they took him into the castle.</p>

<p>Next morning the giants prepared to go out hunting,
and, before leaving, they said to him, &lsquo;You must on no
account go into the first room by the dining-hall.&rsquo;
Hardly, however, were the giants well out of sight
before the young man began to reason thus with himself:
&lsquo;I see very well that I have come into a place from
which I shall never go out alive with my head, so I may
as well see what is in the room, come what may afterwards.&rsquo;
So he went and opened the door a little and
peeped in. There stood a golden ass, bound to a golden
manger. He looked at it a little, and was just going to
shut the door when the ass said, &lsquo;Come and take the
halter from my head, and keep it hidden about you. It
will serve you well if you only understand how to use
it.&rsquo; So he took the halter, and, after fastening the room
door, quickly concealed it under his clothes. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
not sat very long before the giants came home. They
asked him at once if he had been in the first room, and
he, much frightened, replied, &lsquo;No, I have not been in.&rsquo;
&lsquo;But we know that you have been!&rsquo; said the giants in
great anger, and seizing some large sticks, they beat
him so severely that he could hardly stand on his feet.
It was very lucky for him that he had the halter wound
round his body under his clothes, or else he would
certainly have been killed.</p>

<p>The next day the giants again prepared to go out
hunting, but before leaving him they ordered him on no
account to enter the second room.</p>

<p>Almost as soon as the giants had gone away he became
so very curious to see what might be in the second
room, that he could not resist going to the door. He
stood there a little, thinking within himself, &lsquo;Well, I
am already more dead than alive, much worse cannot
happen to me!&rsquo; and so he opened the door and looked
in. There he was surprised to see a very beautiful girl,
dressed all in gold and silver, who sat combing her hair,
and setting in every tress a large diamond. He stood
admiring her a little while, and was just going to shut
the door again, when she spoke, &lsquo;Wait a minute, young
man. Come and take this key, and mind you keep it
safely. It will serve you some time, if you only know
how to use it.&rsquo; So he went in and took the key from the
girl, and then, going out, fastened the door and went
and sat down in the same place he had sat before.</p>

<p>He had not remained there very long before the
giants came home from hunting. The moment they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
entered the house they took up their large sticks to beat
him, asking, at the same time, whether he had been in
the second room.</p>

<p>Shaking all over with fear, he answered them, &lsquo;No,
I have not!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But we know that you have been,&rsquo; shouted the giants
in great anger, and they then beat him worse than on
the first day.</p>

<p>The next morning, as the giants went out as usual to
hunt, they said to him, &lsquo;Do not go into the third room,
for anything in the world; for if you do go in we shall
not forgive you as we did yesterday, and the day before!
We shall kill you outright!&rsquo; No sooner, however, had
the giants gone out of sight, than the young man began
to say to himself, &lsquo;Most likely they will kill me, whether
I go into the room or not. Besides, if they do not kill
me, they have beaten me so badly already that I am sure
I cannot live long, so, anyhow, I will go and see what
is in the third room.&rsquo; Then he got up and went and
opened the door.</p>

<p>He was quite shocked, however, when he saw that
the room was full of human heads! These heads
belonged to young men who had come, like himself, to
learn the trade that no one knows, and who, having
obeyed faithfully and strictly the orders of the giants,
had been killed by them.</p>

<p>The young man was turning quickly to go away,
when one of the heads called out, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, but
come in!&rsquo; Thereupon he went into the room. Then
the head gave him an iron chain, and said, &lsquo;Take care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
of this chain, for it will serve you some time if you
know how to use it!&rsquo; So he took the chain, and going
out fastened the door.</p>

<p>He went and sat down in the usual place to wait for
the coming home of the giants, and, as he waited, he
grew quite frightened, for he fully expected that they
would really kill him this time.</p>

<p>The instant the giants came home they took up their
thick sticks and began to beat him without stopping
to ask anything. They beat him so terribly that he
was all but dead; then they threw him out of the house,
saying to him, &lsquo;Go away now, since you have learnt
the trade that no one knows!&rsquo; When he had lain a
long time on the ground where they had thrown him,
feeling very sore and miserable, at length he tried to
move away, saying to himself, &lsquo;Well, if they really
have taught me the trade that no one knows, for the
sake of the king&rsquo;s daughter I can suffer gladly all this
pain, if I can only win her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>After travelling for a long time, the young man
came at last to the palace of the king whose daughter
he wished to marry. When he saw the palace, he was
exceedingly sad, and remembered the words of the
princess; for, after all his wanderings and sufferings, he
had learnt no trade, and had never been able to find
what trade it was &lsquo;that no one knows.&rsquo; Whilst considering
what he had better do, he suddenly recollected
the halter, the key, and the iron chain, which he had
carried concealed about him ever since he left the castle
of the four giants. He then said to himself, &lsquo;Let me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
see what these things can do!&rsquo; So he took the halter
and struck the earth with it, and immediately a handsome
horse, beautifully caparisoned, stood before him.
Then he struck the ground with the iron chain, and
instantly a hare and a greyhound appeared, and the
hare began to run quickly and the greyhound to follow
her. In a moment the young man hardly knew himself,
for he found himself in a fine hunting-dress, riding on
the horse after the hare, which took a path that passed
immediately under the windows of the king&rsquo;s palace.
Now, it happened that the king stood at a window
looking out, and noticed at once the beautiful greyhound
which was chasing the hare, and the very handsome
horse which a huntsman in a splendid dress was
mounted on. The king was so pleased with the
appearance of the horse and the greyhound, that he
called instantly some of his servants, and, sending them
after the strange rider, bade them invite him to come
to the palace. The young man, however, hearing some
people coming behind him calling and shouting, rode
quickly behind a thick bush, and shook a little the halter
and the iron chain. In a moment the horse, the greyhound,
and the hare had vanished, and he found himself
sitting on the ground under the trees dressed in his old
shabby clothes. By this time the king&rsquo;s servants had
come up, and, seeing him sit there, they asked him
whether he had seen a fine huntsman on a beautiful
horse pass that way. But he answered them rudely,
&lsquo;No! I have not seen anyone pass, neither do I care to
look to see who passes!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
Then the king&rsquo;s servants went on and searched the
forest, calling and shouting as loudly as they could, but
it was all in vain; they could neither see nor hear
anything of the hunter. At length they went back to
the king, and told him that the horse the huntsman
rode was so exceedingly quick that they could not hear
anything of him in the forest.</p>

<p>The young man now resolved to go to the hut where
his old parents lived; and they were glad to see that he
had come back to them once more.</p>

<p>Next morning, the son said to his father, &lsquo;Now,
father, I will show you what I have learned. I will
change myself into a beautiful horse, and you must
lead me into the city and sell me, but be very careful
not to give away the halter, or else I shall remain always
a horse!&rsquo; Accordingly, in a moment he changed
himself into a horse of extraordinary beauty, and the
father took him to the market-place to sell him. Very
soon a great number of people gathered round the horse,
wondering at his unusual beauty, and very high prices
were offered for him; the old man, however, raised the
price higher and higher at every offer. The news
spread quickly about the city that a wonderfully handsome
horse was for sale in the market-place, and at
length the king himself heard of it, and sent some
servants to bring the horse, that he might see it. The
old man led the horse at once before the palace, and the
king, after looking at it for some time with great
admiration, could not help exclaiming, &lsquo;By my word,
though I am a king, I never yet saw, much less rode, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
handsome a horse!&rsquo; Then he asked the old man if he
would sell it him. &lsquo;I will sell it to your Majesty, very
willingly,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;but I will sell only the
horse, and not the halter.&rsquo; Thereupon the king
laughed, saying, &lsquo;What should I want with your dirty
halter? For such a horse I will have a halter of gold
made!&rsquo; So the horse was sold to the king for a very
high price, and the old man returned home with the
money.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, there was a great stir and
much consternation in the royal stables, for the beautiful
horse had vanished somehow during the night. And
at the time when the horse disappeared, the young man
returned to his parents&rsquo; hut.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards the young man said to his
father, &lsquo;Now I will turn myself into a fine church not
far from the king&rsquo;s palace, and if the king wishes to
buy it you may sell it him, only be sure not to part
with the key or else I must remain always a church!&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the king got up that morning, and went to his
window to look out, he saw a beautiful church which
he had never noticed before. Then he sent his servants
out to see what it was, and soon after they came back
saying, that &lsquo;the church belonged to an old pilgrim,
who told them that he was willing to sell it if the
king wished to buy it.&rsquo; Then the king sent to ask what
price he would sell it for, and the pilgrim replied, &lsquo;It
is worth a great deal of money.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Whilst the servants were bargaining with the father
an old woman came up. Now this was the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
old woman who had sent the young man to the castle
of the four giants, and she herself had been there and
had learnt the trade that no one knew. As she understood
at once all about the church, and had no mind
to have a rival in the trade, she resolved to put an end
to the young man. For this purpose she began to outbid
the king, and offered, at last, so very large a sum of
ready money, that the old man was quite astonished
and confused at seeing the money which she showed
him. He accordingly accepted her offer, but whilst
he was counting the money, quite forgot about the key.
Before long, however, he recollected what his son had
said, and then, fearing some mischief, he ran after the
old woman and demanded the key back. But the old
woman could not be persuaded to give back the key,
and said it belonged to the church which she had bought
and paid for. Seeing she would not give up the key,
the old man grew more and more alarmed, lest some ill
should befall his son, so he took hold of the old woman
by the neck and forced her to drop the key. She
struggled very hard to get it back again, and, whilst
the old man and she wrestled together, the key changed
itself suddenly into a dove and flew away high in the
air over the palace gardens.</p>

<p>When the old woman saw this, she changed herself
into a hawk and chased the dove. Just, however, as
the hawk was about to pounce upon it, the dove turned
itself into a beautiful bouquet, and dropped down into
the hand of the king&rsquo;s daughter who happened to
be walking in the garden. Then the hawk changed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
again into the old woman, who went to the gate of the
palace and begged very hard that the princess would
give her that bouquet, or, at least, one single flower
from it.</p>

<p>But the princess said, &lsquo;No! not for anything in the
world! These flowers fell to me from heaven!&rsquo; The
old woman, however, was determined to get one flower
from the bouquet, so, seeing the princess would not
hear her, she went straight to the king, and begged
piteously that he would order his daughter to give her
one of the flowers from her bouquet. The king, thinking
the old woman wanted one of the flowers to cure
some disease, called his daughter to him, and told her
to give one to the beggar.</p>

<p>But just as the king said this, the bouquet changed
itself into a heap of millet-seed and scattered itself all
over the ground. Then the old woman quickly changed
herself into a hen and chickens, and began greedily to
pick up the seeds. Suddenly, however, the millet
vanished, and in its place appeared a fox, which sprang
on the hen and killed her.</p>

<p>Then the fox changed into the young man, who explained
to the astonished king and princess that he it
was who had demanded the hand of the princess, and
that, in order to obtain it, he had wandered all over
the world in search of some one who could teach him
&lsquo;the trade that no one knows.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the king and his daughter heard this, they
gladly fulfilled their part of the bargain, seeing how
well the young man had fulfilled his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
Then, shortly afterwards, the king&rsquo;s daughter married
the son of the poor old couple; and the king built for
the princess and her husband a palace close to his own.
There they lived long and had plenty of children, and
people say that some of their descendants are living at
present, and that these go constantly to pray in the
church, which is always open because the key of it
turned itself into a young man who married the king&rsquo;s
daughter, after he had shown to her that he had done as
she wished, and learnt, for her sake, &lsquo;the trade that no
one knows.&rsquo;</p>

<h2><a name="chap22" id="chap22"></a>THE THREE SUITORS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N a very remote country there formerly lived a king
who had only one child,&mdash;an exceedingly beautiful
daughter. The princess had a great number of suitors,
and amongst them were three young noblemen, whom
the king loved much. As, however, the king liked the
three nobles equally well, he could not decide to which
of the three he should give his daughter as a wife. One
day, therefore, he called the three young noblemen to
him, and said, &lsquo;Go all of you and travel about the
world. The one of you who brings home the most remarkable
thing shall become my son-in-law!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The three suitors started at once on their travels, each
of them taking opposite ways, and going in search of
remarkable things into distant and different countries.</p>

<p>A long time had not passed before one of the young
nobles found a wonderful carpet which would carry
rapidly through the air whoever sat upon it.</p>

<p>Another of them found a marvellous telescope,
through which he could see everybody and everything
in the world, and even the many-coloured sands at the
bottom of the great deep sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
The third found a wonder-working ointment, which
could cure every disease in the world, and even bring
dead people back to life again.</p>

<p>Now the three noble travellers were far distant from
each other when they found these wonderful things.
But when the young man who had found the telescope
looked through it he saw one of his former friends and
present rivals walking with a carpet on his shoulder,
and so he set out to join him. As he could always see,
by means of his marvellous telescope, where the other
nobleman was, he had no great difficulty in finding
him, and when the two had met, they sat side by side
on the wonderful carpet, and it carried them through
the air until they had joined the third traveller.</p>

<p>One day, when each of them had been telling of the
remarkable things he had seen in his travels, one of
them exclaimed suddenly, &lsquo;Now let us see what the
beautiful princess is doing, and where she is.&rsquo; Then
the noble who had found the telescope looked through
it and saw, to his great surprise and dismay, that the
king&rsquo;s daughter was lying very sick, and at the point of
death. He told this to his two friends and rivals, and
they, too, were as thunderstruck at the bad news&mdash;until
the one who had found the wonder-working ointment,
remembering it suddenly, exclaimed, &lsquo;I am sure I could
cure her, if I could only reach the palace soon enough!&rsquo;
On hearing this, the noble who had found the wonderful
carpet, cried out, &lsquo;Let us sit down on my carpet, and it
will quickly carry us to the king&rsquo;s palace!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the three nobles gently placed themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
on the carpet, which rose instantly in the air, and carried
them direct to the king&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>The king received them immediately; but said very
sadly, &lsquo;I am sorry for you; for all your travels have
been in vain. My daughter is just dying, so she can
marry none of you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the nobleman who possessed the wonder-working
ointment said respectfully, &lsquo;Do not fear, sire,
the princess will not die!&rsquo; And on being permitted to
enter the apartment where she lay sick, he placed the
ointment so that she could smell it. In a few moments
the princess revived, and when her waiting-women had
rubbed a little of the ointment in her skin she recovered
so quickly that in a few days she was better
than she had been before she was taken ill.</p>

<p>The king was so glad to have his daughter given back
to him, as he thought, from the grave, that he declared
that she should marry no one but the young nobleman
whose wonderful ointment had cured her.</p>

<p>But now a great dispute arose between the three young
nobles; the one who possessed the ointment affirmed
that had he not found it the princess would have died,
and could not, therefore, have married any one; the
noble who owned the telescope declared that had he not
found the wonderful telescope they would never have
known that the princess was dying, and so his friend
would not have brought the ointment to cure her; whilst
the third noble proved to them that had he not found
the wonderful carpet, neither the finding of the ointment
nor the telescope would have helped the princess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
since they could not have travelled such a great distance
in time to save her.</p>

<p>The king, overhearing this dispute, called the young
noblemen to him, and said to them, &lsquo;My lords, from
what you have said, I see that I cannot, with justice,
give my daughter to any of you; therefore, I pray you
to give up altogether the idea of marrying her, and that
you continue friends as you always were before you
became rivals.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The three young nobles saw that the king had decided
justly; so they all left their native country, and
went into a far-off desert to live like hermits. And
the king gave the princess to another of his great nobles.</p>

<p>Many, many years had passed away since the marriage
of the princess, when her husband was sent by her
father to a distant country with which the king was
waging war. The nobleman took his wife, the princess,
with him, as he was uncertain how long he might
be forced to remain abroad. Now it happened that a
violent storm arose just as the vessel, in which the
princess and her husband were, was approaching a
strange coast, and in the height of the great tempest
the ship dashed on some rocks, and went to pieces instantly.
All the people on board perished in the waves,
excepting only the princess, who clung very fast to a
boat, and was carried by the wind and the tide to the
sea-shore. There she found what seemed to be an uninhabited
country, and, finding a small cave in a rock,
she lived in it alone three years, feeding on wild herbs
and fruits. She searched every day to find some way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
out of the forest which surrounded her cave, but could
find none. One day, however, when she had wandered
farther than usual from the cave where she lived, she
came suddenly on another cave, which had, to her great
astonishment, a small door. She tried over and over
again to open the door, thinking she would pass the
night in the cave; but all her efforts were unavailing,
it was shut so fast. At length, however, a deep voice
from within the cave called out, &lsquo;Who is at the door?&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this the princess was so surprised that she could
not answer for some moments; when, however, she had
recovered a little, she said, &lsquo;Open me the door!&rsquo; Immediately
the door was opened from within, and she saw,
with sudden terror, an old man with a thick grey beard
reaching below his waist, and long white hair flowing
over his shoulders.</p>

<p>What frightened the princess the more was her finding
a man living here in the same desert where she had
lived herself three years without seeing a single soul.</p>

<p>The hermit and the princess looked at each long and
earnestly without saying a word. At length, however,
the old man said, &lsquo;Tell me, are you an angel or a
daughter of this world?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the princess answered, &lsquo;Old man, let me rest
a moment, and then I will tell you all about myself, and
what brought me here!&rsquo; So the hermit brought out
some wild pears, and when the princess had taken some
of them, she began to tell him who she was, and how she
came in that desert. She said, &lsquo;I am a king&rsquo;s daughter,
and once, many years ago, three young nobles of my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>226]</a></span>
father&rsquo;s court asked the king for my hand in marriage.
Now the king had such an equal affection for all these
three young men that he was unwilling to give pain to
any of them, so he sent them to travel into distant
countries, and promised to decide between them when
they returned.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The three noblemen remained a long time away;
and whilst they were still abroad somewhere, I fell
dangerously ill. I was just at the point of death,
when they all three returned suddenly; one of them
bringing a wonderful ointment which cured me at
once; the two others brought each equally remarkable
things&mdash;a carpet that would carry whoever sat on it
through the air, and a telescope with which one could
see everybody and everything in the world, even to the
sands at the bottom of the sea.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The princess had gone on thus far with her story,
when the hermit suddenly interrupted her, saying, &lsquo;All
that happened afterwards I know as well as you can
tell me. Look at me, my daughter! I am one of those
noblemen who sought to win your hand, and here is
the wonderful telescope.&rsquo; And the hermit brought out
the instrument from a recess in the side of his cave
before he continued, &lsquo;My two friends and rivals came
with me to this desert. We parted, however, immediately,
and have never met since. I know not whether
they are living or dead, but I will look for them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the hermit looked through his telescope, and
saw that the other two noblemen were living in caves
like his, in different parts of the same desert. Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
found this out, he took the princess by the hand, and
led her on until they found the other hermits. When
all were re-united, the princess related her adventures
since the ship, in which her husband was, had gone
down, and she alone had been saved.</p>

<p>The three noble hermits were pleased to see her alive
once again, but at once decided that they ought to
send her back to the king, her father.</p>

<p>Then they made the princess a present of the wonderful
telescope, and the wonder-working ointment, and
placed her on the wonderful carpet, which carried her
and her treasures quickly and safely to her father&rsquo;s
palace. As for the three noblemen, they remained, still
living like hermits, in the desert, only they visited each
other now and then, so that the years seemed no longer
so tedious to them. For they had many adventures to
relate to each other.</p>

<p>The king was exceedingly glad to receive his only
child back safely, and the princess lived with her father
many years but neither the king nor his daughter could
entirely forget the three noble friends who, for her
sake, lived like hermits in a wild desert in a far-off
land.</p>

<h2><a name="chap23" id="chap23"></a>THE GOLDEN-HAIRED TWINS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, a long, long while ago, there
lived a young king who wished very much to
marry, but could not decide where he had better look for
a wife.</p>

<p>One evening as he was walking disguised through the
streets of his capital, as it was his frequent custom to
do, he stopped to listen near an open window where he
heard three young girls chatting gaily together.</p>

<p>The girls were talking about a report which had been
lately spread through the city, that the king intended
soon to marry.</p>

<p>One of the girls exclaimed, &lsquo;If the king would marry
me I would give him a son who should be the greatest
hero in the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The second girl said, &lsquo;And if I were to be his wife I
would present him with two sons at once. Two twins
with golden hair.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the third girl declared that were the king to
marry <em>her</em> she would give him a daughter so beautiful
that there should not be her equal in the whole wide
world!</p>

<p>The young king listened to all this, and for some time
thought over their words, and tried to make up his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
mind which of the three girls he should choose for his
wife. At last he decided that he would marry the one
who had said she would bring him twins with golden
hair.</p>

<p>Having once settled this in his own mind, he ordered
that all preparations for his marriage should be made
forthwith, and shortly after, when all was ready, he
married the second girl of the three.</p>

<p>Several months after his marriage, the young king,
who was at war with one of the neighbouring princes,
received tidings of the defeat of his army, and heard
that his presence was immediately required in the camp.
He accordingly left his capital and went to his army,
leaving the young queen in his palace to the care of
his stepmother.</p>

<p>Now the king&rsquo;s stepmother hated her daughter-in-law
very much indeed, so when the young queen was
near her confinement, the old queen told her that it
was always customary in the royal family for the heirs
to the throne to be born in a garret.</p>

<p>The young queen (who knew nothing about the
customs in royal families except what she had learnt
from hearing or seeing since her marriage to the king)
believed implicitly what her mother-in-law told her,
although she thought it a great pity to leave her
splendid apartments and go up into a miserable attic.</p>

<p>Now when the golden-haired twins were born, the
old queen contrived to steal them out of their cradle,
and put in their place two ugly little dogs. She then
caused the two beautiful golden-haired boys to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
buried alive in an out-of-the-way spot in the palace
gardens, and then sent word to the king that the young
queen had given him two little dogs instead of the heirs
he was hoping for. The wicked stepmother said in her
letter to the king that she herself was not surprised at
this, though she was very sorry for his disappointment.
As to herself, she had a long time suspected the young
queen of having too great a friendship for goblins and
elves, and all kinds of evil spirits.</p>

<p>When the king received this letter, he fell into a
frightful rage, because he had only married the young
girl in order to have the golden-haired twins she had
promised him as heirs to his throne.</p>

<p>So he sent word back to the old queen that his wife
should be put at once into the dampest dungeon in the
castle, an order which the wicked woman took good
care to see carried out without delay. Accordingly the
poor young queen was thrown into a miserably dark
dungeon under the palace, and kept on bread and water.</p>

<p>Now there was only a very small hole in this prison&mdash;hardly
large enough to let in light and air&mdash;yet the old
queen managed to cause a great many people to pass by
this hole, and whoever passed was ordered to spit at and
abuse the unhappy young queen, calling out to her,
&lsquo;Are you really the queen? Are you the girl who
cheated the king in order to be a queen? Where are
your golden-haired twins? You cheated the king and
your friends, and now the witches have cheated you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the young king, though terribly angry and mortified
at his great disappointment, was, at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
time, too sad and troubled to be willing to return to his
palace. So he remained away for fully nine years.
When he at last consented to return, the first thing he
noticed in the palace gardens were two fine young trees,
exactly the same size and the same shape.</p>

<p>These trees had both golden leaves and golden blossoms,
and had grown up of themselves from the very
spot where the stepmother of the king had buried the
two golden-haired boys she had stolen from their cradle.</p>

<p>The king admired these two trees exceedingly, and
was never weary of looking at them. This, however,
did not at all please the old queen, for she knew that
the two young princes were buried just where the
trees grew, and she always feared that by some means
what she had done would come to the king&rsquo;s ears. She
therefore pretended that she was very sick, and declared
that she was sure she should die unless her stepson, the
king, ordered the two golden-leaved trees to be cut
down, and a bed made for her out of their wood.</p>

<p>As the king was not willing to be the cause of her
death, he ordered that her wishes should be attended
to, notwithstanding he was exceedingly sorry to lose his
favourite trees.</p>

<p>A bed was soon made from the two trees, and the
seemingly sick old queen was laid on it as she desired.
She was quite delighted that the golden-leaved trees
had disappeared from the garden; but when midnight
came, she could not sleep a bit, for it seemed to her
that she heard the boards of which her bed was made in
conversation with each other!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
At last it seemed to her, that one board said, quite
plainly, &lsquo;How are you, my brother?&rsquo; And the other
board answered, &lsquo;Thank you, I am very well; how are
you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, I am all right,&rsquo; returned the first board;
&lsquo;but I wonder how our poor mother is in her dark
dungeon! Perhaps she is hungry and thirsty!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The wicked old queen could not sleep a minute all
night, after hearing this conversation between the
boards of her new bed; so next morning she got up very
early and went to see the king. She thanked him for
attending to her wish, and said she already was much
better, but she felt quite sure she would never recover
thoroughly unless the boards of her new bed were cut
up and thrown into a fire. The king was sorry to lose
entirely even the boards made out of his two favourite
trees, nevertheless he could not refuse to use the means
pointed out for his stepmother&rsquo;s perfect recovery.</p>

<p>So the new bed was cut to pieces and thrown into
the fire. But whilst the boards were blazing and
crackling, two sparks from the fire flew into the courtyard,
and in the next moment two beautiful lambs with
golden fleeces and golden horns were seen gambolling
about the yard.</p>

<p>The king admired them greatly, and made many inquiries
who had sent them there, and to whom they
belonged. He even sent the public crier many times
through the city, calling on the owners of the golden-fleeced
lambs to appear and claim them; but no one
came, so at length he thought he might fairly take them
as his own property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
The king took very great care of these two beautiful
lambs, and every day directed that they should be well
fed and attended to; this, however, did not at all please
his stepmother. She could not endure even to look on
the lambs with their golden fleeces and golden horns,
for they always reminded her of the golden-haired twins.
So, in a little while she pretended again to be dangerously
sick, and declared she felt sure she should soon
die unless the two lambs were killed and cooked for
her.</p>

<p>The king was even fonder of his golden-fleeced lambs
than he had been of the golden-leaved trees, but he
could not long resist the tears and prayers of the old
queen, especially as she seemed to be very ill. Accordingly,
the lambs were killed, and a servant was
ordered to carry their golden fleeces down to the river
and to wash the blood well out of them. But whilst the
servant held them under the water, they slipped, in
some way or another, out of his fingers, and floated
down the stream, which just at that place flowed very
rapidly. Now it happened that a hunter was passing
near the river a little lower down, and, as he chanced to
look in the water, he saw something strange in it. So
he stepped into the stream, and soon fished out a small
box which he carried to his house, and there opened it.
To his unspeakably great surprise, he found in the box
two golden-haired boys. Now the hunter had no
children of his own; he therefore adopted the twins
he had fished out of the river, and brought them up
just as if they had been his own sons. When the twins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
were grown up into handsome young men, one of them
said to his foster-father, &lsquo;Make us two suits of beggar&rsquo;s
clothes, and let us go and wander a little about the
world!&rsquo; The hunter, however, replied and said, &lsquo;No, I
will have a fine suit made for each of you, such as is
fitting for two such noble-looking young men.&rsquo; But as
the twins begged hard that he should not spend his
money uselessly in buying fine clothes, telling him that
they wished to travel about as beggars, the hunter&mdash;who
always liked to do as his two handsome foster-sons
wished&mdash;did as they desired, and ordered two suits of
clothes, like those worn by beggars, to be prepared for
them. The two sons then dressed themselves up as
beggars, and as well as they could hid their beautiful
golden locks, and then set out to see the world. They
took with them a gusle<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and a cymbal, and maintained
themselves with their singing and playing.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><span class="label"><a href="#FNanchor_33_33">[33]</a></span>
&lsquo;Gusle,&rsquo; one-stringed instrument on which the Servian bards
accompany their recitation of ballads. <a href="#FNanchor_33_33">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>They had wandered about in this way some time
when one day they came to the king&rsquo;s palace. As the
afternoon was already pretty far advanced, the young
musicians begged to be allowed to pass the night in one
of the outbuildings belonging to the court, as they
were poor men, and quite strangers in the city. The
old queen, however, who happened to be just then in
the courtyard saw them, and hearing their request, said
sharply that beggars could not be permitted to enter
any part of the king&rsquo;s palace. The two travellers said
they had hoped to pay for their night&rsquo;s lodging by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
songs and music, as one of them played and sung to the
gusle, and the other to the cymbal.</p>

<p>The old queen, however, was not moved by this, but
insisted on their going away at once. Happily for the
two brothers the king himself came out into the courtyard
just as his stepmother angrily ordered them to go
away, and at once directed his servants to find a place
for the musicians to sleep in, and ordered them to provide
the brothers with a good supper. After they had
supped, the king commanded them to be brought before
him that he might judge of their skill as musicians,
and that their singing might help him to pass the time
more pleasantly.</p>

<p>Accordingly, after the two young men had taken the refreshment
provided for them, the servants took them into
the king&rsquo;s presence, and they began to sing this ballad:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The pretty bird, the swallow, built her nest with
care, in the palace of the king. In the nest she reared
up happily two of her little ones. A black, ugly-looking
bird, however, came to the swallow&rsquo;s nest to mar
her happiness, and to kill her two little ones. And the
ugly black bird succeeded in destroying the happiness
of the poor little swallow; the little ones, however,
although yet weak and unfledged, were saved, and, when
they were grown up and able to fly, they came to look at
the palace where their mother, the pretty swallow, had
built her nest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This strange song the two minstrels sung so very
sweetly that the king was quite charmed, and asked
them the meaning of the words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
Whereupon the two meanly dressed young men took
off their hats, so that the rich tresses of their golden
hair fell down over their shoulders, and the light
glanced so brightly upon it that the whole hall was
illuminated by the shining. They then stepped forward
together, and told the king all that had happened
to them and to their mother, and convinced him
that they were really his own sons.</p>

<p>The king was exceedingly angry when he heard all
the cruel things his stepmother had done, and he gave
orders that she should be burnt to death. He then
went with the two golden-haired princes to the miserable
dungeon wherein his unfortunate wife had been
confined so many years, and brought her once more
into her beautiful palace. There, looking on her golden-haired
sons, and seeing how much the king, their
father, loved them, she soon forgot all her long years
of misery. As to the king, he felt that he could never
do enough to make amends for all the misfortunes his
queen had lived through, and all the dangers to which his
twins sons had been exposed. He felt that he had too easily
believed the stories of the old queen, because he would
not trouble himself to inquire more particularly into the
truth or falsehood of the strange things she had told him.</p>

<p>After all this mortification, and trouble, and misery,
everything came right at last. So the king and his
wife, with their golden-haired twins, lived together long
and happily.</p>

<h2><a name="chap24" id="chap24"></a>THE DREAM OF THE KING&rsquo;S SON.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once a king who had three sons. One
evening, when the young princes were going to
sleep, the king ordered them to take good note of their
dreams and come and tell them to him next morning.</p>

<p>So, the next day the princes went to their father as
soon as they awoke, and the moment the king saw them
he asked of the eldest, &lsquo;Well, what have you dreamt?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince answered, &lsquo;I dreamt that I should be the
heir to your throne.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the second said, &lsquo;And I dreamt that I should
be the first subject in the kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the youngest said, &lsquo;<em>I</em> dreamt that I was going to
wash my hands, and that the princes, my brothers, held
the basin, whilst the queen, my mother, held fine towels
for me to dry my hands with, and your majesty&rsquo;s self
poured water over them from a golden ewer.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king, hearing this last dream, became very
angry, and exclaimed, &lsquo;What! I&mdash;the king&mdash;pour
water over the hands of my own son! Go away this
instant out of my palace, and out of my kingdom!
You are no longer my son.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>238]</a></span>
The poor young prince tried hard to make his peace
with his father, saying that he was really not to be
blamed for what he had only dreamed; but the king
grew more and more furious, and at last actually thrust
the prince out of the palace.</p>

<p>So the young prince was obliged to wander up and
down in different countries, until one day, being in a
large forest, he saw a cave, and entered it to rest.
There, to his great surprise and joy, he found a large
kettle full of Indian corn, boiling over a fire and, being
exceedingly hungry, began to help himself to the corn.
In this way he went until he was shocked to see he had
nearly eaten up all the maize, and then, being afraid
some mischief would come of it, he looked about for a
place in which to hide himself. At this moment, however,
a great noise was heard at the cave-mouth, and
he had only time to hide himself in a dark corner before
a blind old man entered, riding on a great goat and
driving a number of goats before him.</p>

<p>The old man rode straight up to the kettle, but as
soon as he found that the corn was nearly all gone, he
began to suspect some one was there, and groped about
the cave until he caught hold of the prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; asked he sharply; and the prince
answered, &lsquo;I am a poor, homeless wanderer about the
world, and have come now to beg you to be good enough
to receive me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;why not? I shall at least
have some one to mind my corn whilst I am out with
my goats in the forest.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
So they lived together for some time; the prince remaining
in the cave to boil the maize, whilst the old
man drove out his goats every morning into the forest.</p>

<p>One day, however, the old man said to the prince, &lsquo;I
think you shall take out the goats to-day, and I will
stay at home to mind the corn.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This the prince consented to very gladly, as he was
tired of living so long quietly in the cave. But the
old man added, &lsquo;Mind only one thing! There are nine
different mountains, and you can let the goats go freely
over eight of them, but you must on no account go on
the ninth. The Vilas (<i>fairies</i>) live there, and they will
certainly put out your eyes as they have put out mine,
if you venture on their mountain.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince thanked the old man for his warning,
and then, mounting the great goat, drove the rest of the
goats before him out of the cave.</p>

<p>Following the goats, he had passed over all the
mountains to the eighth, and from this he could see the
ninth mountain, and could not resist the temptation he
felt to go upon it. So he said to himself, &lsquo;I will
venture up, whatever happens!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he stepped on the ninth mountain before
the fairies surrounded him, and prepared to put out
his eyes. But, happily a thought came into his head,
and he exclaimed, quickly, &lsquo;Dear Vilas, why take this
sin on your heads? Better let us make a bargain, that
if you spring over a tree that I will place ready to
jump over, you shall put out my eyes, and I will not
blame you!&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
So the Vilas consented to this, and the prince went
and brought a large tree, which he cleft down the
middle almost to the root; this done, he placed a wedge
to keep the two halves of the trunk open a little.</p>

<p>When it was fixed upright, he himself first jumped
over it, and then he said to the Vilas, &lsquo;Now it is your
turn. Let us see if you can spring over the tree!&rsquo;</p>

<p>One Vila attempted to spring over, but the same
moment the prince knocked the wedge out, and the
trunk closing, at once held the Vila fast. Then all
the other fairies were alarmed, and begged him to open
the trunk and let their sister free, promising, in return,
to give him anything he might ask. The prince said,
&lsquo;I want nothing except to keep my own eyes, and to
restore eyesight to that poor old man.&rsquo; So the fairies
gave him a certain herb, and told him to lay it over the
old man&rsquo;s eyes, and then he would recover his sight.
The prince took the herb, opened the tree a little so as
to let the fairy free, and then rode back on the goat to
the cave, driving the other goats before him. When he
arrived there he placed at once the herb on the old
man&rsquo;s eyes, and in a moment his eyesight came back, to
his exceeding surprise and joy.</p>

<p>Next morning the old man, before he drove out his
goats, gave the prince the keys of eight closets in the
cave, but warned him on no account to open the ninth
closet, although the key hung directly over the door.
Then he went out, telling the prince to take good care
that the corn was ready for their suppers.</p>

<p>Left alone in the cave, the young man began to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
wonder what might be in the ninth closet, and at last
he could not resist the temptation to take down the key
and open the door to look in.</p>

<p>What was his surprise to see there a golden horse,
with a golden greyhound beside him, and near them a
golden hen and golden chickens were busy picking up
golden millet-seeds.</p>

<p>The young prince gazed at them for some time,
admiring their beauty, and then he spoke to the golden
horse, &lsquo;Friend, I think we had better leave this place
before the old man comes back again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; answered the golden horse, &lsquo;I am quite
willing to go away, only you must take heed to what I
am going to tell. Go and find linen cloth enough to
spread over the stones at the mouth of the cave, for if
the old man hears the ring of my hoofs he will be
certain to kill you. Then you must take with you a
little stone, a drop of water, and a pair of scissors, and
the moment I tell you to throw them down you must
obey me quickly, or you are lost.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The prince did everything that the golden horse had
ordered him, and then, taking up the golden hen
with her chickens in a bag, he placed it under his arm,
and mounted the horse and rode quickly out of the cave,
leading with him, in a leash, the golden greyhound.
But the moment they were in the open air the old
man, although he was very far off, tending his goats
on a distant mountain, heard the clang of the golden
hoofs, and cried to his great goat, &lsquo;They have run away.
Let us follow them at once.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
In a wonderfully short time the old man on his great
goat came so near the prince on his golden horse, that
the latter shouted, &lsquo;Throw now the little stone!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The moment the prince had thrown it down, a high
rocky mountain rose up between him and the old man
and before the goat had climbed over it, the golden
horse had gained much ground. Very soon, however,
the old man was so nearly catching them that the horse
shouted, &lsquo;Throw, now, the drop of water!&rsquo; The prince
obeyed instantly, and immediately saw a broad river
flowing between him and his pursuer.</p>

<p>It took the old man on his goat so long to cross the
river that the prince on his golden horse was far away
before them; but for all that it was not very long
before the horse heard the goat so near behind him that
he shouted, &lsquo;Throw the scissors.&rsquo; The prince threw
them, and the goat, running over them, injured one of
his forelegs very badly. When the old man saw this,
he exclaimed, &lsquo;Now I see I cannot catch you, so you
may keep what you have taken. But you will do
wisely to listen to my counsel. People will be sure to
kill you for the sake of your golden horse, so you had
better buy at once a donkey, and take the hide to cover
your horse. And do the same with your golden greyhound.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Having said this, the old man turned and rode back
to his cave; and the prince lost no time in attending to
his advice, and covered with donkey-hide his golden
horse and his golden hound.</p>

<p>After travelling a long time the prince came unawares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>243]</a></span>
to the kingdom of his father. There he heard that the
king had had a ditch&mdash;three hundred yards wide and
four hundred yards deep&mdash;dug, and had proclaimed
that whosoever should leap his horse over it, should
have the princess, his daughter, for wife.</p>

<p>Almost a whole year had elapsed since the proclamation
was issued, but as yet no one had dared to risk
the leap. When the prince heard this, he said, &lsquo;I will
leap over it with my donkey and my dog!&rsquo; and he leapt
over it.</p>

<p>But the king was very angry when he heard that a
poorly dressed man, on a donkey, had dared to leap over
the great ditch which had frightened back his bravest
knights; so he had the disguised prince thrown into
one of his deepest dungeons, together with his donkey
and his dog.</p>

<p>Next morning the king sent some of his servants to
see if the man was still living, and these soon ran back
to him, full of wonder, and told him that they had found
in the dungeon, instead of a poor man and his donkey, a
young man, beautifully dressed, a golden horse, a
golden greyhound, and a golden hen, surrounded by
golden chickens, which were picking up golden millet-seeds
from the ground.</p>

<p>Then the king said, &lsquo;That must be some powerful
prince.&rsquo; So he ordered the queen, and the princes, his
sons, to prepare all things for the stranger to wash his
hands. Then he went down himself into the dungeon,
and led the prince up with much courtesy, desiring to
make thus amends for the past ill-treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
The king himself took a golden ewer full of water,
and poured some over the prince&rsquo;s hands, whilst the
two princes held the basin under them, and the queen
held out fine towels to dry them on.</p>

<p>This done, the young prince exclaimed, &lsquo;Now, my
dream is fulfilled;&rsquo; and they all at once recognised him,
and were very glad to see him once again amongst
them.</p>

<h2><a name="chap25" id="chap25"></a>THE THREE BROTHERS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was once upon a time an old man whose
family consisted of his wife, three sons, and
a daughter. They were exceedingly poor, and finding
that they could not possibly all live at home, the three
sons and the daughter went out into the world in
different directions to find some means of living. Thus
the old man and his wife remained alone.</p>

<p>Having neither horses nor oxen, the old man was
obliged to go every day to the forest for fuel, and carry
home the firewood on his back.</p>

<p>On one occasion it was nearly evening when he
started to go to the forest, and his wife, who was afraid
to remain alone in the house, begged very hard to be
permitted to go with him. He objected very much at
first, but as she persisted in her entreaties, he at length
consented to her following him, first bidding her, however,
take good care to make the house-door safe, lest
some one should break into the house.</p>

<p>The old woman thought the door would be safest
if she took it off its hinges, and carried it away on her
back. So she took it off and followed her husband as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
fast as she was able. The old man, however, was not
angry when he saw how she had mistaken his words,
and the manner she had chosen to make sure of the
door; for, he reflected, there was little or nothing at all
in the house for any one to steal.</p>

<p>When they had reached the forest the husband began
to cut wood, and his wife gathered the branches together
in a heap. Meanwhile it had got very late, and
they were anxious as to how they should pass the night,
seeing their own house was so far off that they
would be unable to reach it before morning, and there
were no houses in the neighbourhood where they could
sleep. At last they observed a very tall and widely
spreading pine-tree, and they resolved to climb up and
pass the night on one of its branches.</p>

<p>The man got up first, and his wife followed him,
drawing, with great difficulty, the door after her. Her
husband advised her to leave the door on the ground
under the tree; but she would not listen to him, and
could not be persuaded to remain in the tree without
her house-door. Hardly had they settled themselves
on a branch, the old woman holding fast her door, before
they heard a great noise, which came nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>They were excessively frightened at the noise, and
dared neither speak nor move.</p>

<p>In a short time they saw a captain of robbers followed
by twelve of his men, approach the tree; the robbers
were dressed all alike, in gold and silver, and one of
them carried a sheep killed and ready for roasting.
When the old man and woman saw the band of robbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
come and settle under the pine-tree in which they had
themselves taken refuge they thought their time was
come, and gave themselves up for lost.</p>

<p>As soon as the robbers had settled themselves, the
youngest of them made a fire and put the sheep down to
roast, whilst the captain conversed with the others.
The sheep was already roasted and cut up, and the
robbers had begun with great gaiety to eat it, when
the old woman told her husband that she could not possibly
hold the door any longer, but must let it fall. The
old man begged her piteously not to let it go, but to hold
it fast and keep quiet, lest the robbers should discover
and kill them. The old woman said, however, that she
was so exceedingly tired she could no longer by any
possibility hold it. The old man, seeing it was no good
talking about it, declared that, as he could not hold his
corner of the door any longer when she had let go her
corner, it was not worth while to complain, &lsquo;since,&rsquo; as
he said, &lsquo;what must be must be, and it is no use to be
sorry for anything in this world.&rsquo; Thereupon they both
loosened their holds of the door at once, and it fell down,
making a great noise&mdash;especially with its iron lock&mdash;as
it fell from branch to branch.</p>

<p>The door made so much noise in falling, that the
whole forest re-echoed with the sound.</p>

<p>The robbers, greatly astonished at the noise, and too
frightened by the unexpected clashing above their heads
to see what was the cause, took to their heels, without
once thinking of the roast sheep they left behind, or of
any of the treasures which they had brought with them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
One of them alone did not run away far from the spot,
but hid himself behind a tree, and waited to see what
might come of so much noise.</p>

<p>The old couple, seeing the robbers did not return,
came down from the tree, and, being exceedingly
hungry, began to eat heartily; the old man all the time
praising the wisdom of his wife in throwing down the
door.</p>

<p>The robber who had hidden himself, seeing only the
old people near the fire, came up to them, and begged
to be allowed to share their meal, as he had not eaten
anything for the last twenty-four hours. This they permitted,
and spoke of all kinds of things, until the old
man exclaimed suddenly to the robber, &lsquo;Take care! you
have a hair on your tongue! Do not choke yourself,
for I have no means to bury you here!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The brigand took this joke in earnest, and begged
the old man to take the hair out of his mouth, and he
would in return show him a cave wherein a great
treasure was hidden. As he was describing the great
heaps of gold ducats, thalers, shillings, and other coins
which he said were in the cave, the old woman interrupted
him, saying, &lsquo;I will take the hair out of your
mouth, without pay! Only put your tongue out and
shut your eyes!&rsquo; The robber very gladly did as she
told him, and she caught up a knife and in a moment
cut off a piece of his tongue. Then she said, &lsquo;Well,
now! I have taken the hair out!&rsquo; When the robber felt
what had been done to him he jumped up and down in
pain, and at length ran away without hat or coat in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
same direction as his companions had gone, shouting
all the time, &lsquo;Help! help! give me some plaster!&rsquo; His
companions, hearing imperfectly these words, misunderstood
him, and thought he cried to them, &lsquo;Help yourselves;
here is the police-master!&rsquo; especially as he ran as
if the captain of police with a large force was at his
heels. Accordingly, the robbers themselves ran faster
and farther away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old couple thought it no longer safe
to stay under the pine-tree, so they gathered up quickly
all the money, whether gold or silver, which they could
carry, and hurried back to their home. When they got
there they found the hens of the neighbours had pulled
off the thatch of their house; they were, however, the
less sorry for this, since they had now money enough to
build another and a better home. And this they did,
and continued to live in their fine new house without
once remembering their sons and daughter, who had
been wandering about the world already some nine long
years.</p>

<p>In the meantime the sons and the daughter had been
working each in a different part of the world. When,
however, they had been away from their home nine
years, they all, as if by common consent, conceived an
ardent desire to go back once more to their father&rsquo;s
house. So they took the whole of the savings which
they had laid up in their nine years&rsquo; service, and commenced
their journeys homewards.</p>

<p>On his travels the eldest brother met with three
gipsies, who were teaching a young bear to dance by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
putting him on a red-hot plate of iron. He felt compassion
for the creature in its sufferings, and asked the
gipsies why they were thus tormenting the animal.
&lsquo;Better,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let me have it, and I will give you
three pieces of silver for it!&rsquo; The gipsies accepted the
offer eagerly, took the three pieces of silver, and gave
him the bear. Travelling farther on he met with some
huntsmen who had caught a young wolf, which they
were about to kill. He offered them, also, three pieces
of silver for the animal, and they, pleased to get so
much, readily sold it. A little further still he met some
shepherds, who were about to hang a little dog. He was
sorry for the poor brute, and offered to give them two
pieces of silver if they would give the dog to him, and
this they very gladly agreed to.</p>

<p>So he travelled on homeward, attended by the young
bear, the wolf-cub, and the little dog. As all his nine
years&rsquo; savings had amounted only to nine pieces of
silver, he had now but a single piece left.</p>

<p>Before he reached his father&rsquo;s house he met some boys
who were about to drown a cat. He offered them his
last piece of money if they would give him the cat, and
they were content with the bargain and gave it up to
him. So, at last, he arrived at his home without any
money, but with a bear, a wolf, a dog, and a cat.</p>

<p>Just so, it had happened with the other two brothers.
By their nine years&rsquo; work they had only saved nine
pieces of silver, and on their way home they had spent
them in ransoming animals, exactly as the eldest
brother had done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>251]</a></span>
The sister, in her nine years&rsquo; service, had saved only
five pieces of money. As she travelled homeward she
met with a hedgehog who was buying from a mouse its
iron teeth, offering in exchange for them its bone teeth
and two pieces of money besides.</p>

<p>When she had listened a while to their bargaining,
she said to the mouse, &lsquo;My dear little mouse, I offer
you the hedgehog&rsquo;s teeth and three pieces of silver
besides!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The mouse instantly agreed to this bargain. So she
caught the hedgehog, drew its teeth, and gave them,
with three pieces of silver, to the mouse, who gave her
in return its iron teeth.</p>

<p>As she went on her journey she began to suspect that
the mouse had deceived her. To see if this was so or not
she determined to make trial of the teeth, and, going
a little aside from the road, she found a thick oak-tree
and began to bite at it. It seemed to her that she had
hardly begun to gnaw at the tree when it already commenced
shaking, and threatened to fall. Seeing this,
she was satisfied that she had really got the iron teeth,
and so went on her journey quite contented.</p>

<p>Before she reached her father&rsquo;s house she observed a
mouse sharpening its teeth upon a stone. So she
begged the mouse to lend her the stone, that she might
sharpen her teeth also. The mouse, however, refused
to do this unless she gave two pence. Without much
reflection, she took out her last two pieces of money and
handed them to the mouse, which gave her in return the
stone to sharpen her teeth with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>252]</a></span>
Then she resumed her journey homeward. As she
walked, however, she reflected upon what she should
say when her parents and brothers asked her where she
had been, and how much she had saved during the nine
years she had been from home.</p>

<p>When she reached home she found her three brothers
already there with their treasures&mdash;that is to say, with
their bears, wolves, dogs, and cats. Luckily for her,
her brothers did not ask her how much she had saved,
for they felt sure that she must have made large savings.
They asked her only about her health, and how she had
travelled, and were all very glad that they were once
again united together as a family.</p>

<p>This joy, however, did not last long. Soon after they
had returned, the old father died. Then the three
brothers consulted together, and decided to invest part
of the money, which their father and mother had got
from the robbers, in the purchase of four horses and
one grass-field.</p>

<p>But their affairs did not go on very smoothly. One
morning, instead of three horses in the stable they
found only two; the third horse had been killed. Something
had bitten it, sucked its blood, and devoured half
of its body! And it was the finest of the three horses
which had been killed. After this, the brothers resolved
for the future to keep watch every night in the stable.
When night came, they consulted as to which of them
should first keep guard, and the youngest brother said,
&lsquo;<em>I</em> will do so.&rsquo; Accordingly, after having supped, he
went to the stable to sleep there. Just about midnight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>253]</a></span>
came into the stable a creature all in white, and jumped
at once on the youngest horse and began to gnaw it.
When the brother who was watching saw that, he was
in a great fright; so much so, indeed, that without
stopping to find the doors, he got out through a hole in
the roof. Whilst he was thus making his escape, the
monster killed the horse, sucked its blood, and ate up
half the body.</p>

<p>Next day, when the elder brothers saw what had
happened, they made a great lamentation over their
loss. At night the eldest brother said to the second,
&lsquo;Now do you go and keep a good watch; it is your
horse that is in danger!&rsquo; So the second brother went
at once into the stable and lay down. Again, about
midnight, the thing in white came in, and the watcher,
as much frightened as his younger brother had been the
night before, jumped up and escaped just as he had
done. The monster, having bitten the horse, sucked its
blood, and ate up half of it.</p>

<p>Next morning, when he saw what had happened, the
eldest brother said that <em>he</em> would keep guard at night
over the remaining horse. So at night he went into
the stable, gave his horse plenty of hay, and placed
himself in a corner to watch. Again, when it was about
midnight, the same creature in white came in. Seeing
it coming he was first frightened, but soon rallied his
spirits and stood, holding his breath, to see what would
follow.</p>

<p>He saw that the thing in white looked something
like his sister, and carried in its hand a whetstone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>254]</a></span>
Coming up to the horse the monster bit it, sucked its
blood, and, after having eaten up half the body, left
the stable. All that time the eldest brother had remained
quiet, never stirring at all. Perhaps he did
this from fear; perhaps, however, because he had
resolved to be quiet, whatever might happen.</p>

<p>Next morning, when the younger brothers found that
the horse had been killed and half devoured, during
their eldest brother&rsquo;s watch, they began to laugh and
to tease him with his loss. He told them that <em>he</em>, however,
knew what they did not&mdash;who it was that had
killed and eaten their horses; but that they must not
speak a word about it to any one. He then told them
that their own sister had slain their horse, and had
sucked the blood. At first they refused to believe this;
soon, however, they were convinced that it was true.
And the proof came in this way.</p>

<p>One morning the two elder brothers went into the
fields to work, and the younger remained at home.
Their sister likewise remained at home, without knowing,
however, that her youngest brother was also in
the house. The eldest brother on going out had
directed the youngest to place a kettle with water on
the fire to boil, and to keep stirring the fire under it.
In case the water should turn to blood he was immediately
to open the cellar, let out a little dog, and bid it
follow the way which they had taken when they went
into the fields.</p>

<p>When the two brothers were gone, the youngest went
to walk in the yard, and on coming back heard a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>255]</a></span>
noise and wailing in the house. So he went to the
house-door and looked in through the keyhole; and
what do you think he saw? His sister had cut her old
mother&rsquo;s throat, and was just about to put the body
on a spit to roast. On seeing this, he was terribly
frightened, and ran to hide himself behind a large tub
which stood in the kitchen. Shortly afterward his
sister brought the spit out of doors, and put it before the
fire to roast, speaking aloud, &lsquo;I shall do the same with
my three brothers, one after the other, and then I shall
remain alone the mistress of the entire property.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When the roasting was done, she carried the spit
with the body into the room, and leaning it against
a wall, brought out the whetstone and began to sharpen
the teeth.</p>

<p>The moment she went inside the house, the youngest
brother jumped up from his hiding-place, rushed to the
door, and from the outside watched what she was doing.
When he had seen this, he filled the kettle, stirred up
the fire, and then hid himself near the furnace. Having
sharpened her teeth, his sister ate up the body of her
mother, all except the head. After she had finished her
meal, taking the head in her hand, she went out to the
kitchen. On seeing the fire burning so well, and the
kettle filled with water, she became angry, and began
to look about to discover whether any one was in the
house. Suspecting one of her brothers might be there,
she shouted aloud, calling her brothers by their names,
and searched everywhere in the house. Luckily, however,
she forgot to look by the side of the furnace, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>256]</a></span>
her younger brother lay hidden. Not finding any one
in the house, she then took her mother&rsquo;s head in her
hand and ran out, following the way her brothers had
gone to their work in the fields. As she ran she
shouted, &lsquo;Wait a little! Don&rsquo;t think you have escaped
me!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The youngest brother, seeing his sister had run away,
came out of his concealment to look at the water in
the kettle. He saw the water had turned to blood, so
he went quickly to the cellar and let out one of the
little dogs which his sister feared more than all her
brothers.</p>

<p>Having let the dog free, the youngest brother came
back to the kettle, to see what would happen to the
water on the fire. By this time all the water, which
had turned to blood, was boiling quickly, and throwing
up a great number of bubbles; these bubbles rose the
quicker the nearer the sister came to her two brothers in
the field. When she was not more than five steps from
them, however, she suddenly heard a noise, as if someone
was running behind her; so she turned to look, and,
seeing the dog coming, was terrified, and tried to save
herself by climbing a tree which was close by. When,
however, she caught at a branch, it broke in her hand,
and she fell to the ground, and the same instant the dog
rushed at her, and bit her into two pieces. The two
brothers saw all this, but they were afraid to come near
her lest she should again revive and attack them. Soon,
however, seeing the dog was tearing her to pieces, they
became convinced that she was really dead, so they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>257]</a></span>
came to the spot where she was, and took up her body
and buried it, together with their mother&rsquo;s head, under
the tree by which she had fallen.</p>

<p>After they had done this, the two brothers returned
home, and told their youngest brother all that had
happened. He, on his part, told them how the boiling
water had turned to blood and at first bubbled up
quicker and quicker, but how, after some time, it grew
quieter, and, at length, turned again to water. Then
the three brothers congratulated themselves at having
got rid of their terrible sister. A few days later they
all went into the fields to bring in the hay which the
two elder ones had mown. They found, however, hardly
the third part of the hay which they had left. At this
they wondered greatly, and looked about to see who had
stolen it; but, finding no one, after a little while they
took up what was left and returned home.</p>

<p>At length the year, on which all this had happened,
passed away. The next year, however, they dared not
leave their mown grass unwatched. So they discussed
which of them should first keep guard. Each of them
offered to do it; but, at last, they agreed that the
youngest brother should begin to watch. So he prepared
himself, and, at night, went out into the field.
Having come there, he climbed up into the tree under
which his sister&rsquo;s body and his mother&rsquo;s head lay buried,
and resolved to remain there until daybreak. About
midnight he heard a great noise and shouting, which
frightened him so much that he dared not stir at all.
Some creatures came into the field and eat up most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>258]</a></span>
the hay, and what they did not eat they tossed about
and spoiled, so that it was fit for nothing. When daylight
came, the youngest brother came down from the
tree and went home, to tell what he had seen.</p>

<p>So that year they had no hay.</p>

<p>Next year, when hay harvest came, the three brothers
took counsel together how to preserve their hay. The
second brother now volunteered to watch in the field,
and seemed quite sure he would be able to save the hay.
Accordingly he went, and climbed into the tree, just
as his brother had done the previous year. About midnight
three winged horses came into the field with a
company of fairies. The winged horses began to eat
the newly mown hay, and the fairies danced over it.
After the greater part of the hay had been eaten by the
horses, and all the rest had been spoiled by the dancing
of the fairies, the whole company left the field, just as
day began to dawn. The watcher in the tree had witnessed
all this; he was, however, too frightened to do
anything&mdash;indeed, he hardly dared to move. When he
went home, he told his brothers all that he had seen;
at which they were sad, since this year again they would
have no hay.</p>

<p>However, the time passed, and the third summer
came on. Again the three brothers cut the grass in
their meadow, and consulted together anxiously how
they should manage to keep their new hay.</p>

<p>At length it was settled that it was now the turn of
the eldest brother to keep watch. If he, also, failed to
save the hay, it was agreed that they should divide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>259]</a></span>
amongst them the little property which they had left,
and go out again, separately, to seek their fortunes in
the world, seeing they had no luck in their own country.</p>

<p>As had been agreed upon, the eldest brother now
went out into the field at night; but, instead of going
up into the tree as his brothers had done, he lay quietly
down on a heap of hay, and waited to see what would
happen. About midnight he heard a great noise, afar
off, and, by-and-by, a troop of fairies, with three winged
horses, came straight towards the place where he lay.
Having got there, the fairies began to dance, and the
horses to eat the hay, and canter about. The eldest
brother looked on, and, at first, felt much afraid, and
wished heartily the whole company would go away
without seeing him. As, however, they seemed in no
hurry to do this, he considered what he should do, and,
at length, decided that it would be worth while to try
to catch one of the three horses. So, when they came
near him, he jumped on the back of one of them, and
clung fast to it. The other two horses instantly ran
away, and the fairies with them.</p>

<p>The horse which the eldest brother had caught tried
all sorts of tricks to throw off his unwelcome rider,
but he could not succeed. Finding all his attempts to
free himself quite useless, at last he said, &lsquo;Let me go,
my good man, and I will be of use to you some other
time.&rsquo; The man answered, &lsquo;I will set you free on one
condition; that is, you must promise never more to
come in this field; and you must give me some pledge
that you will keep your promise.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>260]</a></span>
The horse gladly agreed to this condition, and gave
the man a hair from his tail, saying, &lsquo;Whenever you
happen to be in need, hold this hair to a fire, and I
will instantly be at your service.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon the horse went off, and the eldest brother
returned home. His brothers had waited impatiently
for his return, and, when they saw him, pressed him
immediately to tell them all that had happened. So he
told everything, except that he had got a hair from
the horse&rsquo;s tail, because he did not believe that the horse
would keep his promise and come to him in his need.
The two younger brothers, however, had no confidence
that the fairies and winged horses would fulfil their
promise and never come again to ruin their hay-field,
so they proposed that the property should be at once
divided, and that they should separate. The eldest
brother tried to persuade them to remain at least one
other year longer, to see what would happen; he was
not able, however, to succeed in this. Accordingly they
divided the remnant of their property, took each their
animals, that is, each his bear, his wolf, his dog, and
his cat, and left their home, for the second time, to
seek their fortunes in the world.</p>

<p>The first day they travelled together, but the second
day they were obliged to separate, because having come
to a crossway, and trying to keep on the same path,
they found they could not take a step forward so long
as they were together. They therefore left that path
and tried another; it was, however, of no use, for they
could not move a step forward as long as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>261]</a></span>
together; and when they tried the third path, the same
happened there also. So they tried if two of them could
go on in one road if one of them went before and the
other behind. But this also they were unable to do;
they could not get on one step, try as hard as they
would, so nothing was left them but to separate and
each of them to go alone by a different road. They
were exceedingly sorry to part, but could not help
themselves.</p>

<p>Before the brothers separated, the eldest brother said,
&lsquo;Now, brothers, before we part, let us stick our knives
in this oak-tree; as long as we live our knives will
remain where we stick them; when one of us dies, his
knife will fall out. Let us, then, come here every
third year to see if the knives are still in their places.
Thus we shall know something, at least, about each
other.&rsquo; The other two agreed to this, and, having stuck
their knives in the oak-tree, and kissed each other,
went, each one his own way, taking his animals with
him.</p>

<p>Let us first follow the youngest brother in his wanderings.
He travelled, with his attendant animals, all
that day and the following night without stopping, and
the next day saw before him a king&rsquo;s palace, and went
straight towards it. Having been taken into the
presence of the king, he begged his majesty to employ
him in watching his goats. The king consented to take
him as goat-herd, and from that day he had the charge
of the king&rsquo;s goats and lived on thus quietly for a long
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>262]</a></span>
One day the new goat-herd chanced to drive his flock
to a high hill, not far from the king&rsquo;s palace. On the
summit of the hill there was a very tall pine-tree, and
the instant he saw it he resolved to climb up and look
about from its top on the surrounding country. Accordingly,
he climbed up, and enjoyed exceedingly the
extensive and beautiful prospect. As he looked in one
direction he saw, a long way off, a great smoke arising
from a mountain. The moment he saw the smoke he
fancied that one of his brothers must be there, as he
thought it unlikely that any one else would be in such
a wilderness. So he resolved at once to give up his
place of goat-herd, and travel to the mountain which
he had seen in the distance. Coming down from the
tree, therefore, he immediately collected his goats, which
was a very easy task for him to do, since he had such
good help in his bear, his wolf, his dog, and his cat.</p>

<p>No sooner had he reached the palace than he went
straight to the king and said, &lsquo;Sir, I can no longer
be your Majesty&rsquo;s goat-herd. I must go away, for I
saw to-day a smoking mountain, and I believe that one
of my brothers is there, and I wish to go and see if
this be so. I therefore beg your Majesty to pay me
what you owe me, and to let me go!&rsquo; All this time he
thought the king knew nothing about the smoking
mountain.</p>

<p>When he had said this, however, the king immediately
began to advise him on no account to go to the
mountain&mdash;for, as he assured him, whoever went there
never came back again. He told him that all who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>263]</a></span>
gone thither seemed at once to have sunk into the
earth, for no one ever heard anything more about them.
All the king&rsquo;s warnings and counsels, however, availed
nothing; the goat-herd was bent on going to the
smoking mountain, and looking after his two
brothers.</p>

<p>After he had made all preparations for the journey
he set out, accompanied, as usual, by his four animals.
He went straight to the mountain; but, having got
there, he could not at first find the fire. Indeed, he
had trouble enough before he discovered it. At length,
however, he found a large fire burning under a beech-tree,
and went near it to warm himself. At the
same time he looked about on all sides to see who had
made the fire. After looking about some time he heard
a woman&rsquo;s voice, and upon his looking up to see whence
the sound came, he saw an old woman sitting on one
of the branches above his head. She sat huddled together
all of a heap, and shaking with cold.</p>

<p>No sooner had he discovered her than the old woman
begged him to allow her to come down to the fire and
warm herself a little. So he told her she might come
down and warm herself as soon as she pleased. She
answered, however, &lsquo;Oh, my son, I dare not come down
because of your company. I am afraid of the animals you
have with you&mdash;your bear, and wolf, and dog,
and cat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this he tried to re-assure her and said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
afraid! They will do you no harm.&rsquo; However she
would not trust them, so she plucked a hair from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>264]</a></span>
head, and threw it down, saying, &lsquo;Put that hair on their
necks and then I shall not be afraid to come down.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly the man took the hair and threw it over
his animals, and in a moment the hair was turned into
an iron chain which kept his four-footed followers bound
fast together.</p>

<p>When the old woman saw that he had done as she
desired, she came down from the tree and took her place
by the fire. She seemed at first a very little woman;
as she sat by the fire, however, she began to grow larger.
When he saw this he was greatly astonished, and said
to her, &lsquo;But, my old woman, it seems to me that you
grow bigger and bigger!&rsquo; Thereupon she answered,
shivering, &lsquo;Ha! ha! no, no, my son! I am only warming
myself!&rsquo; But, nevertheless, she continued to grow
taller and taller, and had already grown half as tall as
the beech-tree. The goat-herd watched her growing
with wide-open eyes, and, beginning to get frightened,
said again, &lsquo;But really you are getting a fearful
size, and are growing taller and taller every
moment.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ha, ha, my son,&rsquo; she coughed and shivered, &lsquo;I am
only warming myself!&rsquo; Seeing, however, that she was
now as tall as the tallest beech-tree, and, fearing that
his life was in danger, he called anxiously to his companions,
&lsquo;Hold her fast, my bear! Hold her fast, my
wolf! Hold her fast, my dog! Hold her fast, my
cat!&rsquo; But it was all in vain that he called to them;
none of them could move a step from their places.
When he saw that, he endeavoured to run away, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>265]</a></span>
found that he could no more move from his place than
if he were fast chained to it. Then the old woman,
seeing everything had gone on just as she wished, bent
down a little, and, touching him with her little finger,
said, &lsquo;Go, you have lost your head!&rsquo; and the self-same
moment he turned to ashes. After that, she touched,
with the little toe of her left foot, all his animals, one
after the other, and they also turned at once to ashes
as their master had done.</p>

<p>Having collected all the ashes she buried them under
an oak-tree. Then as soon as she took the iron chain
in her hand, it turned again into a hair, which she put
back into its place on her head.</p>

<p>She had before done with many young and noble
knights just as she had now done with this poor goat-herd.</p>

<p>The second brother, after serving a long time in a
strange place, was seized with a great desire to go to
the oak-tree at the cross-roads, where he had parted with
his brothers, in order to see if their knives were still
sticking in the tree. When he got there, he found the
knife of his eldest brother still firmly fixed in the
trunk of the oak, but his youngest brother&rsquo;s knife had
fallen to the ground. Then he knew that his younger
brother was dead, or in great danger of death, and he
resolved at once to follow the way he had gone and try
to discover what had become of him. Going then along
the same road which his younger brother had travelled,
he came, on the third day, to the king&rsquo;s palace, and
went in and begged the king to take him into his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>266]</a></span>
service. Whereupon the king took him as goat-herd,
exactly as he had taken before the youngest brother.</p>

<p>When the second brother had tended the king&rsquo;s goats
a long time, he one day drove them up a high hill, and,
finding there a very tall pine-tree, resolved at once to
climb up to its top and look about to see what kind of
a country lay on the other side of the hill. When he
had looked round a while from the tree he noticed a great
volume of smoke rising from a mountain afar off, and
the thought came at once to his mind that his brothers
might be there. Accordingly, he came down quickly,
collected his goats, and went back to the king&rsquo;s palace,
followed by his four companions, that is to say, by his
bear, his wolf, his dog, and his cat. When he had
reached the palace he went straight to the king, and
begged him to pay him his wages at once, and to let
him go to look after his brothers; for he had seen a
smoke upon a mountain, and he believed they were
there. The king tried in vain to dissuade him by telling
him that none who went there ever came back; but all
his Majesty&rsquo;s words availed nothing. Thereupon,
seeing he was decided on going, the king paid him what
he owed him, and let him go.</p>

<p>He at once set out, and went straight to the mountain;
but, when he got there, he was a long time before he
could find any fire. At last, however, he found one
burning under a beech-tree, and he went up to it to
warm himself, wondering all the time who had made
it, since he saw no one near. As he warmed himself he
heard a woman&rsquo;s voice in the tree above his head, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>267]</a></span>
looking up, saw there an old woman huddled up on a
branch, and shaking with cold.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw her, the old woman asked him to let
her come down and warm herself by the fire, and he told
her she might come and warm herself as long as she liked.</p>

<p>She said, however, &lsquo;I am afraid of the company which
you have with you. Take this hair and lay it over your
bear, and wolf, and dog, and cat, and then I shall be
able to come down.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So saying, she pulled a hair out of her head and
threw it down. He laughed at her fears, and assured
her that his companions would not hurt her; finding,
however, notwithstanding all he said, that she was still
afraid to come down from the tree, he, at last, took the
hair and laid it on the beasts as she had directed. In an
instant the hair turned into an iron chain, and bound
the four animals fast together. Then the old woman
came down, and took a place by the fire to warm herself.
As the second brother watched her warming herself, he
saw her grow bigger and bigger, until she had grown
half as tall as the beech-tree.</p>

<p>Wondering greatly, he exclaimed, &lsquo;Old woman, you
are growing bigger and bigger.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hy, hy! my son,&rsquo;
said she, coughing and shivering, &lsquo;I am only warming
myself.&rsquo; But when he saw that she was already as tall
as the beech-tree, he became frightened, and called to
his companions, &lsquo;Hold her, my bear! hold her, my wolf!
hold her, my dog! hold her, my cat!&rsquo; They were none
of them, however, able to move, so fast were they held
together by the iron chain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>268]</a></span>
Seeing that, the old woman stooped down and touched
him with her little finger, and he fell immediately into
ashes. Then she touched the four animals, one after
the other, with the little toe of her left foot, and they,
also, crumbled to ashes.</p>

<p>No sooner had the old woman done this than she
collected all the ashes in a heap and buried them under
an oak-tree. As she had before done with the ashes of
many a youthful knight and gentleman, so she did now
with those of this poor simple man. Pity, if they were
to die, that some more worthy means than one hair from
the head of a miserable old woman had not brought
about their deaths!</p>

<p>A very long time had passed, and yet the eldest
brother never once thought of going back to the cross-roads
where he had parted with his brothers. He was
engaged in the service of a good and honest master, and,
finding himself so well off, fancied that his brothers
were the same. His master was an innkeeper, and the
whole work of the servant was to prepare, morning and
evening, the beds of the guests. He did his duty so well
that his master thought of adopting him for his son, as
he himself was childless.</p>

<p>One day a gentleman of great distinction came to pass
the night at the inn, and the servant thought that the
stranger looked remarkably like his youngest brother.
He wished to ask him his name, but could not for
shame; partly because he feared his brother would reproach
him for having forgotten to go to the cross-roads;
partly because the guest&rsquo;s manners were so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>269]</a></span>
polished and his clothes were of fine silk and velvet;
whereas he had left his brother very poorly clad, and of
rustic manners.</p>

<p>As he thought of the likeness which the guest bore
to his youngest brother, he considered that, in his
travels about the world, his brother might have found
wisdom, and by his wisdom might have succeeded in
some way of business, and by his business might have
gained money; and then, having got money, that it
would be easy for him to get as fine clothes as the
stranger wore. Reasoning thus, he took courage at last to
ask the gentleman about his family, and at length grew
bold enough to ask him plainly if he was not his brother.</p>

<p>This, however, the stranger quickly and positively
denied, and asked, in return, about the servant&rsquo;s family.
To all the particulars which the servant gave him he
listened with a smile.</p>

<p>Next morning, the guest left the inn very early; and
when the servant went to arrange the bed in which
he had slept, he found, under the pillow, a little stone.</p>

<p>He thought the stone must be valuable, having been
in the possession of so rich a man, and yet he considered
its loss could hardly be felt by one who went clothed
in silks and velvets. He lifted it to his lips to kiss it,
before putting it in his pocket; but the moment his
lips touched it, two negroes started out and asked him,
&lsquo;What are your orders, sir?&rsquo; He was frightened by
the suddenness of their appearance, and answered, &lsquo;I
do not order anything.&rsquo; Then the negroes disappeared,
and he put the stone in his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>270]</a></span>
The more he thought of this, the more he marvelled
at the wonderful stone, and considered what he should
do with it. By-and-by, in order to find out what the
negroes could do, he took the stone out of his pocket,
and raised it again to his lips. The moment he did so,
the negroes re-appeared, and asked him again, &lsquo;What
do you demand, sir?&rsquo; He replied quickly, &lsquo;I desire
to have the finest clothes prepared for me, of which no
two pieces must be made from the same kind of stuff.&rsquo;
In a very few moments the negroes brought him the
most beautiful clothes possible; so fine indeed were they
all, that he could not decide which piece was the most
beautiful. Then, dismissing the negroes, who disappeared
in the stone, he dressed himself. He was
admiring the fine fit of his clothes, when his
master came to the door of his room, and,
seeing a stranger in such an exceedingly rich
dress, said humbly, &lsquo;Excuse me, sir, where do you come
from?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;From not far off,&rsquo; the servant answered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a moment, sir,&rsquo; said the innkeeper; &lsquo;I will
call my servant to take your orders;&rsquo; and, going outside,
he called loudly for his servant.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the servant quickly threw off his fine
clothes and gave them back to the negroes. Dressing
himself hurriedly in his old clothes, he rushed out of
his room. Then, finding the pantry open, he began to
arrange the things.</p>

<p>His master found him employed in this way, and
ordered him at once to leave that business, and to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>271]</a></span>
into the house to make coffee for a distinguished guest
who had that moment arrived.</p>

<p>The strange guest, however, was nowhere to be found.
The innkeeper looked, with his servant, into all the
rooms, but there was no sign of a guest anywhere. Then
the master, greatly astonished, thought that some
thieves had been playing him a trick, and bid the
servant in future to look more sharply who came in and
who went out of the inn. The servant listened quietly
to his master; but, having once remembered his
brothers, he had now an irresistible desire to look after
them, and so he told the innkeeper that he had resolved
to go away, and desired that he might be paid his
wages.</p>

<p>The innkeeper was very sad at hearing this, and
offered to raise his wages, and tried all means to keep
him; but it was of no use. Seeing that the servant was
resolved to go away, the master then paid him, and let
him leave the inn. Then the eldest brother took with
him his four animals&mdash;his bear, wolf, dog, and cat, and
went away.</p>

<p>After travelling a very long time, his good fortune
brought him to the cross-roads where he had parted
with his brothers. Instantly he rushed to the oak to
see if the knives were still sticking in it, but his own
knife alone stood in the tree. The two others had
fallen out, and he was much grieved at this, believing
that his brothers were dead or that they were in great
danger. In his trouble he had quite forgotten the
wonderful hair and stone which he possessed. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>272]</a></span>
resolved to go and search after his brothers, and therefore
went along the same road his youngest brother had
taken when they parted.</p>

<p>As he travelled he remembered the hair which the
winged horse had given him, and the stone which he
had found at the inn; but these did not much console
him, he was so exceedingly sorry for his brothers.
After travelling some time he found himself before a
large palace, the door-keepers of which asked him if
he would take charge of the king&rsquo;s goats. He said he
would, if the king could only tell him something about
his two brothers, who had travelled that way with a
similar company to that which he had. The king said
that no men with such a company had passed that way
during his reign; and this was quite true, inasmuch as
he had only recently mounted the throne, the old king,
under whom the two brothers had served, having lately
died. However, though the eldest brother could learn
nothing of his two younger brothers, he decided to stay
some time there, and so engaged himself to the king as
goat-keeper.</p>

<p>As he drove the goats out, day by day, he looked
about on all sides for some trace of his brothers; for,
although their knives had fallen out of the oak-tree, he
tried to believe that they were not dead.</p>

<p>One day, as he thus wandered about with his goats,
he met an old man, who was going to the forest, with
his axe on his shoulder, to cut wood.</p>

<p>So he asked him if he had seen anything of his two
brothers. The old man answered, &lsquo;Who knows?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>273]</a></span>
Perhaps they have been lost on that mountain where
so many other men have lost their lives. Drive your
goats up that high hill; from its top you will see a
much higher mountain, which smokes, and never ceases
to smoke. On that mountain many people have been
lost; perhaps your brothers also have perished there.
I will, however, give you one piece of good advice. Do
not go, for anything in the world, to the place where
it smokes. I am now an old man, but I never remember
to have seen one man return who went there. Therefore,
if your life is dear to you, do not go up that mountain.&rsquo;
So saying the old man went off.</p>

<p>The goat-keeper drove his goats up the hill, and,
from its top he saw, as he had been told, a very high
mountain which smoked. He tried to discover if any
living creature was thereon, but he could not see the
traces of a single one there. He considered within himself
whether he should go there or not, and, after
revolving it over in his mind, he at length determined
to go.</p>

<p>In the evening, when he drove the goats home, he
told the king of his intention. The king tried hard to
dissuade him, and promised to raise his wages if he
would stay with him; however, nothing could turn him
from his resolution. So the king paid him, and he
went away.</p>

<p>Having come to the mountain he found the fire, and
wondered who lit it. As he thought over this he heard
a woman&rsquo;s voice, saying, &lsquo;Hy, hy!&rsquo; So he looked up,
and was astonished at seeing, in the branches of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>274]</a></span>
beech-tree over his head, an old woman huddled together.
Her hair was longer than her body, and as
white as snow. When he looked up, she said to him,
&lsquo;My son, I am so cold. I should like to warm myself,
but I am afraid of your beasts. I made that fire myself,
but, seeing you coming with your animals, I was
frightened, and got up here to save myself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, you can now come down again, and warm
yourself as much as you please,&rsquo; said he. However, she
protested, &lsquo;I dare not&mdash;your beasts would bite me. But
I will throw you a hair, and you shall bind them
with it. <em>Then</em> I can come down.&rsquo; The eldest brother
thought to himself: the hair must be a very singular
hair indeed, if it could bind his bear, his wolf, his dog,
and his cat. So, instead of throwing it over the animals,
he threw it into the fire. Meanwhile the old woman
came down from the tree, and they both sat by the fire.
But he never moved his eyes from her.</p>

<p>Very soon she began to grow, and grow, and in a
short time she was ten yards high. Then he remembered
the words of the old wood-cutter, and trembled.
However, he only said to her, &lsquo;How you are growing,
auntie.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, no, my son,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;I am only
warming myself.&rsquo; She still grew taller and taller, and
had grown as tall as the beech-tree, when he again exclaimed,
&lsquo;But how you <em>are</em> growing, old woman!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, my son. I am only warming myself,&rsquo; she
repeated as before.</p>

<p>But he saw that she meant him mischief, so he
shouted to his companions, &lsquo;Hold her, my dog! hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>275]</a></span>
her, my little bear! hold her, my little wolf! hold her,
my pussy!&rsquo; Thereupon they all jumped on the old
woman, and began to tear her. Seeing she was unable
to help herself, she begged him to save her from her
furious enemies, and promised she would give him whatever
he asked. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I demand that you
bring back to life my two brothers, with their companions,
and all those you have destroyed. Besides
that, I demand ten loads of ducats. If you will not
comply with these demands, I shall leave you to be torn
to pieces by my animals.&rsquo; The old woman agreed to do
all this, only she begged hard that one man should not
be brought back to life, because she had said, when she
had turned him to ashes, &lsquo;When <em>you</em> arise, may <em>I</em> lie
down in your place!&rsquo; and, therefore, she was afraid she
should be turned to ashes herself if <em>he</em> came back to life.</p>

<p>As the eldest brother, however, thought that she was
trying to cheat him, he would not comply with her
request.</p>

<p>Finding that she could not otherwise help herself,
she at length said to him, &lsquo;Take some ashes from that
heap under the tree, and throw them over yourself and
your company, and whilst you do so say, &ldquo;Arise up, dust
and ashes&mdash;what I am now may you also be!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Wonder of wonders! The moment he did as she
told him, there arose up crowds of men&mdash;more than ten
thousand of them. On seeing such a multitude of
people coming from under the tree, he was almost struck
senseless with astonishment. But he explained to them
briefly what had happened. Most of them thanked him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>276]</a></span>
heartily; some, however, of them would not believe
him, and said with anger, &lsquo;We would rather you had
not awakened us.&rsquo; Then they went away in crowds;
some took one way, some another, until they were all
dispersed. Only his two brothers remained behind;
though they, too, for some time could not believe that
he was their brother. However, when they saw that
their animals recognised his, they remembered that no
one but themselves had had such a strange company of
beasts. Having recognised each other, the brothers fell
into each other&rsquo;s arms, and embraced affectionately.
Then they divided the ducats which the old woman had
given to the eldest, loaded their animals with their
treasures, and went straight away towards the place
where they were born, and where their parents had died.</p>

<p>As for the old woman, when the last man arose from
the ashes under the oak-tree, she herself crumbled into
ashes under it.</p>

<p>The three brothers built three fine palaces for themselves,
and lived therein some time unmarried. At
length, however, they began to think what would
become of all their property after their deaths, and said
to each other that it would be a pity for them to die
without heirs. So they resolved to marry, that their
wealth might be left to their sons and daughters.</p>

<p>The eldest brother said, &lsquo;Let me go and find the best
wives I can for all three of us; meantime you two
will remain here, and take care of our property.&rsquo; The
others gladly agreed to this, as the eldest brother had
given proofs enough that he was by far the wisest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>277]</a></span>
the three, and they felt sure that he would be able also
to bring this important business to a successful issue.
So he made the needful preparations, and started on his
journey to look out for three wives for himself and the
two younger brothers who remained at home.</p>

<p>After long travelling he arrived at a large city, and
resolved to remain there all night, and to continue his
journey in the morning.</p>

<p>It happened that the king of that place had just
arranged a horse-race, and promised his only daughter
as the prize, and, with her, ten loads of treasure to the
winner.</p>

<p>The very evening the eldest brother arrived he heard
the public bell-man proclaiming aloud through the
streets, that every one who had a horse should come to-morrow
to the royal field, and whoever should spring
first over the ditch should be rewarded with the king&rsquo;s
daughter, and should receive, with her, ten loads of gold.</p>

<p>He listened to the proclamation without saying anything.
Next morning he went out into the king&rsquo;s field
in order to see the racing, and found there already innumerable
horses of all kinds.</p>

<p>A little later came also the princess, the king&rsquo;s
daughter, and behind her were brought ten loads of
treasures.</p>

<p>When he saw the king&rsquo;s daughter he thought her
so exceedingly beautiful that he went instantly a little
aside from the crowd to get a better sight of her. He
then remembered his wonderful stone. Taking it out
he now lifted it to his lips, and immediately the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>278]</a></span>
negroes appeared, and said, &lsquo;Master what do you command?&rsquo;
He replied, &lsquo;Bring me clothes of silk and
velvet, together with precious stones, and ten good
horses! and bring them as soon as possible!&rsquo; He had
not winked twice before the negroes had placed before
him everything which he had demanded. Then he took
out the hair, and striking fire with a flint, held the hair
near it. The moment he did this, the same cream-coloured
horse that had given him the hair stood beside him,
and asked, &lsquo;Master, what do you command?&rsquo; He answered,
&lsquo;I wish that to-day we leave all the other horses
behind us in the race, so that I may gain the king&rsquo;s
daughter. Therefore prepare yourself, and let us go at
once, as the other horses are now ready for starting.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The instant he had spoken these words, the cream-coloured
horse stood, pawing the earth, ready and
eager to begin the race. The man then mounted it,
and off they went. The other racers, having started a
few moments before, were already pretty far from the
starting-point; in an instant, however, he had reached
them, and in another had passed and left them far
behind. When he reached the ditch&mdash;which was a
hundred and five yards deep, and a hundred yards wide&mdash;the
horse made so great a spring that it touched
ground some fifty yards beyond the ditch, broad as it was.</p>

<p>Then he rode back and took the maiden, the king&rsquo;s
daughter, and, placing her behind him on his horse,
carried her off, together with the loads of gold. All
the people, seeing this, wondered greatly who the strange
knight could be who had left all the best horses so far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>279]</a></span>
behind in the race, and had won the beautiful princess,
with all her rich treasures.</p>

<p>He rode along until he came to a wood pretty far from
the city, and there he let his wonderful horse go until
he should want him again. He then took off all his
beautiful clothes, and put on his old dress, and in this
manner went on with the maiden and the loads of gold.</p>

<p>About evening he arrived at a strange city, and
decided to remain there. After he had rested a little
while, the people in the inn told him that all day long
the city bell-man had proclaimed, that whoever had a
good horse should go to-morrow to the horse-race, for
the king of the palace had offered his only daughter as
a prize, together with a hundredweight of gold and
jewels; but that there was a ditch to be sprung over
which was three hundred and fifty yards deep and a
hundred and fifty yards wide. When he heard this he
was greatly pleased, for he was quite sure that he should
win this race also.</p>

<p>Next morning, by the help of the little stone and
the wonderful hair, he was again dressed in the finest
clothes, and mounted on his cream-coloured horse, and
so took his place amongst the racers.</p>

<p>Every one wondered from what country this knight
came, and were delighted at his rich dress; as for
the horse, the people were never tired of admiring it.
When the race-horses were arranged for the start he
remained purposely behind. He knew well enough that
this was of no consequence to him, as in one moment he
could reach and pass them all. At length he started,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>280]</a></span>
and in a moment distanced the fleetest horse, arriving
at the ditch, and leaping over it as if it were nothing.
Then, without waiting a minute, he took possession of
the king&rsquo;s daughter and her treasures, and went straight
to the city where he had left the first king&rsquo;s daughter
and her loads of gold.</p>

<p>Taking the two princesses and all the wealth with
him, he now thought that it was time for him to go
back home. On his way, however, he had the great
good luck to come again to a large city, where he
resolved to remain during the night. There, also, the
public crier had been proclaiming all day long, that the
king had determined to give his only daughter and
fifteen hundredweight of gold to whoever should win
the race which was to be run on the morrow. In this
instance, however, the horses would have to leap over a
ditch one thousand yards deep and four hundred and
fifty yards wide. On hearing this proclamation, the
eldest brother became very joyful, for he knew that no
racer had any chance of beating his wonderful horse.</p>

<p>On the morrow, therefore, by means of his little stone
and the hair, he ordered fifteen horses to be ready, to
carry away the treasures he felt sure of winning, and,
at the same time, directed the negroes to bring him his
fairy courser and dresses so splendid that not even a
king could buy them.</p>

<p>Richly dressed in this way, and mounted, as he was,
on his marvellous horse, all the world, who had
gathered to see the great race, could look at nothing
except at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>281]</a></span>
When all the racers were arranged for the start, he
lingered behind and let them all speed off like falcons.
He wished every one to see that he was the last to start,
that they might not charge him afterwards with having
in any way cheated. When they had already gone
pretty far, he started himself, and in a moment he had
reached them, passed them, and left them all a long,
long distance behind. How could it be otherwise?
When did the crow outfly the falcon? Coming to the
ditch, he touched the bridle a little, and, in an instant,
his horse had leaped over the ditch, and they were safe
on the other side. So, without any delay, he took away
the maiden, together with all the gold, and went back
to the city. Having collected his immense treasures,
he now took with him the three princesses, and went
straight home. As he travelled along with his company,
every one who met him asked him, &lsquo;Where are you
going? are the girls for sale?&rsquo; For you see the princesses
were exceedingly beautiful. But beyond all
others his two brothers, when he reached home, wondered
and were delighted at the sight of the three beautiful
princesses. They did not rejoice half so much over
the great riches he had gained for them as over the
marvellous fairness of the kings&rsquo; daughters whom he
had brought to be their wives.</p>

<p>Thus each of the three brothers married a beautiful
princess; the eldest brother, however, who had shown
himself so much the bravest and wisest of them, married
the youngest and most beautiful of the three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>282]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="chap26" id="chap26"></a>ANIMALS AS FRIENDS AND AS ENEMIES.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time, a long while ago, there lived in a
very far-off country, a young nobleman who was
so exceedingly poor that all his property was an old
castle, a handsome horse, a trusty hound, and a good
rifle.</p>

<p>This nobleman spent all his time in hunting and
shooting, and lived entirely on the produce of the chase.</p>

<p>One day he mounted his well-kept horse and rode off
to the neighbouring forest, accompanied, as usual, by
his faithful hound. When he came to the forest he
dismounted, fastened his horse securely to a young tree,
and then went deep into the thicket in search of game.
The hound ran on at a distance before his master, and
the horse remained all alone, grazing quietly. Now it
happened that a hungry fox came by that way, and
seeing how well-fed and well-trimmed the horse was,
stopped a while to admire him. By-and-by she was so
charmed with the handsome horse, that she lay down in
the grass near him to bear him company.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the young nobleman came back
out of the forest, carrying a stag that he had killed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>283]</a></span>
was extremely surprised to see the fox lying so near
his horse. So he raised his rifle with the intention of
shooting her; but the fox ran up to him quickly and
said, &lsquo;Do not kill me! Take me with you, and I will
serve you faithfully. I will take care of your fine horse
whilst you are in the forest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The fox spoke so pitifully that the nobleman was
sorry for her, and agreed to her proposal. Thereupon
he mounted his horse, placed the stag he had shot before
him, and rode back to his old castle, followed closely by
his hound and his new servant, the fox.</p>

<p>When the young nobleman prepared his supper, he
did not forget to give the fox a due share, and she congratulated
herself that she was never likely to be
hungry again, at least so long as she served so skilful a
hunter.</p>

<p>The next morning the nobleman went out again to
the chase, the fox also accompanied him. When the
young man dismounted and bound his horse, as usual,
to a tree, the fox lay down near it to bear it
company.</p>

<p>Now, whilst the hunter was far off in the depth of
the forest looking for game, a hungry bear came by the
place where the horse was tied, and, seeing how
invitingly fat it looked, ran up to kill it. The fox
hereupon sprang up and begged the bear not to hurt
the horse, telling him if he was hungry he had only to
wait patiently until her master came back from the
forest, and then she was quite sure that the good nobleman
would take him also to his castle and feed him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>284]</a></span>
care for him, as he did for his horse, his hound, and
herself.</p>

<p>The bear pondered over the matter very wisely and
deeply for some time, and at length resolved to follow
the fox&rsquo;s advice. Accordingly he lay down quietly near
the horse, and waited for the return of the huntsman.
When the young noble came out of the forest he was
greatly surprised to see so large a bear near his horse,
and, dropping the stag he had shot from his shoulders,
he raised his trusty rifle and was about to shoot the
beast. The fox, however, ran up to the huntsman and
entreated him to spare the bear&rsquo;s life, and to take him,
also, into his service. This the nobleman agreed to
do; and, mounting his horse, rode back to his castle,
followed by the hound, the fox, and the bear.</p>

<p>The next morning, when the young man had gone
again with his dog into the forest, and the fox and the
bear lay quietly near the horse, a hungry wolf, seeing
the horse, sprang out of a thicket to kill it. The fox
and the bear, however, jumped up quickly and begged
him not to hurt the horse, telling him to what a good
master it belonged, and that they were sure, if he would
only wait, he also would be taken into the same service,
and would be well cared for. Thereupon the wolf,
hungry though he was, thought it best to accept their
counsel, and he also lay down with them in the grass
until their master came out of the forest.</p>

<p>You can imagine how surprised the young nobleman
was when he saw a great gaunt wolf lying so near his
horse! However, when the fox had explained the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>285]</a></span>
matter to him, he consented to take the wolf, also, into
his service. Thus it happened this day that he rode
home followed by the dog, the fox, the bear, and the
wolf. As they were all hungry, the stag he had killed
was not too large to furnish their suppers that night,
and their breakfasts next morning.</p>

<p>Not many days afterwards a mouse was added to the
company, and after that a mole begged so hard for
admission that the good nobleman could not find it in his
heart to refuse her. Last of all came the great bird, the
kumrekusha&mdash;so strong a bird that she can carry in her
claws a horse with his rider! Soon after a hare was
added to the company, and the nobleman took great care
of all his animals and fed them regularly and well, so
that they were all exceedingly fond of him.</p>

<p>One day the fox said to the bear, &lsquo;My good Bruin,
pray run into the forest and bring me a nice large log,
on which I can sit whilst I preside at a very important
council we are going to hold.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Bruin, who had a great respect for the quick wit and
good management of the fox, went out at once to seek
the log, and soon came back bringing a heavy one, with
which the fox expressed herself quite satisfied. Then
she called all the animals about her, and, having
mounted the log, addressed them in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You know all of you, my friends, how very kind and
good a master we have. But, though he is very kind,
he is also very lonely. I propose, therefore, that we find
a fitting wife for him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The assembly was evidently well pleased with this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>286]</a></span>
idea, and responded unanimously, &lsquo;Very good, indeed,
if we only knew any girl worthy to be the wife of our
master; which, however, we do not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the fox said, &lsquo;<em>I</em> know that the king has a
most beautiful daughter, and I think it will be a good
thing to take her for our lord; and therefore I propose,
further, that our friend the kumrekusha should fly at
once to the king&rsquo;s palace, and hover about there until
the princess comes out to take her walk. Then she
must catch her up at once, and bring her here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As the kumrekusha was glad to do anything for her
kind master, she flew away at once, without even waiting
to hear the decision of the assembly on this proposal.</p>

<p>Just before evening set in, the princess came out to
walk before her father&rsquo;s palace; whereupon the great
bird seized her and placed her gently on her outspread
wings, and thus carried her off swiftly to the young
nobleman&rsquo;s castle.</p>

<p>The king was exceedingly grieved when he heard that
his daughter had been carried off, and sent out everywhere
proclamations promising rich rewards to any one
who should bring her back, or even tell him where he
might look for her. For a long time, however, all his
promises were of no avail, for no one in the kingdom
knew anything at all about the princess.</p>

<p>At last, however, when the king was well-nigh in
despair, an old gipsy woman came to the palace and
asked the king, &lsquo;What will you give me if I bring back
to you your daughter, the princess?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The king answered quickly, &lsquo;I will gladly give you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>287]</a></span>
whatever you like to ask, if only you bring me back my
daughter!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the old gipsy went back to her hut in the forest,
and tried all her magical spells to find out where the
princess was. At last she found out that she was living
in an old castle, in a very distant country, with a young
nobleman who had married her.</p>

<p>The gipsy was greatly pleased when she knew this,
and taking a whip in her hand seated herself at once in
the middle of a small carpet, and lashed it with her
whip. Then the carpet rose up from the ground and
bore her swiftly through the air, towards the far country
where the young nobleman lived, in his lonely old castle,
with his beautiful wife, and all his faithful company of
beasts.</p>

<p>When the gipsy came near the castle she made the
carpet descend on the grass among some trees, and
leaving it there went to look about until she could meet
the princess walking about the grounds. By-and-by
the beautiful young lady came out of the castle, and
immediately the ugly old woman went up to her, and
began to fawn on her and to tell her all kinds of strange
stories. Indeed, she was such a good story-teller that
the princess grew quite tired of walking before she was
tired of listening; so, seeing the soft carpet lying nicely
on the green grass, she sat down on it to rest awhile.
The moment she was seated the cunning old gipsy sat
down by her, and, seizing her whip, lashed the carpet
furiously. In the next minute the princess found herself
borne upon the carpet far away from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>288]</a></span>
husband&rsquo;s castle, and before long the gipsy made it descend
into the garden of the king&rsquo;s palace.</p>

<p>You can easily guess how glad he was to see his lost
daughter, and how generously he gave the gipsy even
more than she asked as a reward. Then the king made
the princess live from that time in a very secluded tower
with only two waiting-women, so afraid was he lest she
would again be stolen from him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fox, seeing how miserable and melancholy
her young master appeared after his wife had so
strangely been taken from him, and having heard of
the great precautions which the king was using in order
to prevent the princess being carried off again, summoned
once more all the animals to a general council.</p>

<p>When all of them were gathered about her, the fox
thus began: &lsquo;You know all of you, my dear friends, how
happily our kind master was married; but you know,
also, that his wife has been unhappily stolen from him,
and that he is now far worse off than he was before we
found the princess for him. <em>Then</em> he was lonely; <em>now</em>
he is more than lonely&mdash;he is desolate! This being the
case, it is clearly our duty, as his faithful servants, to
try in some way to bring her back to him. This, however,
is not a very easy matter, seeing that the king has
placed his daughter for safety in a strong tower. Nevertheless,
I do not despair, and my plan is this: I will
turn myself into a beautiful cat, and play about in the
palace gardens under the windows of the tower in which
the princess lives. I dare say she will long for me
greatly the moment she sees me, and will send her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>289]</a></span>
waiting-women down to catch me and take me up to her.
But I will take good care that the maids do not catch
me, so that, at last, the princess will forget her father&rsquo;s
orders not to leave the tower, and will come down herself
into the gardens to see if she may not be more
successful. I will then make believe to let her catch
me, and at this moment our friend, the kumrekusha,
who must be hovering over about the palace, must fly
down quickly, seize the princess, and carry her off as
before. In this way, my dear friends, I hope we shall
be able to bring back to our kind master his beautiful
wife. Do you approve of my plan?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Of course, the assembly were only too glad to have
such a wise councillor, and to be able to prove their
gratitude to their considerate master. So the fox ran
up to the kumrekusha, who flew away with her under
her wing, both being equally eager to carry out the
project, and thus to bring back the old cheerful look to
the face of their lord.</p>

<p>When the kumrekusha came to the tower wherein the
princess dwelt she set the fox down quietly among the
trees, where it at once changed into a most beautiful
cat, and commenced to play all sorts of graceful antics
under the window at which the princess sat. The cat
was striped all over the body with many different
colours, and before long the king&rsquo;s daughter noticed
her, and sent down her two women to catch her and
bring her up in the tower.</p>

<p>The two waiting-women came down into the garden,
and called, &lsquo;Pussy! pussy!&rsquo; in their sweetest voices;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>290]</a></span>
they offered her bread and milk, but they offered it all
in vain. The cat sprang merrily about the garden, and
ran round and round them, but would on no account
consent to be caught.</p>

<p>At length the princess, who stood watching them at
one of the windows of her tower, became impatient, and
descended herself into the garden, saying petulantly,
&lsquo;You only frighten the cat: let me try to catch her!&rsquo;
As she approached the cat, who seemed now willing to
be caught, the kumrekusha darted down quickly, seized
the princess by the waist, and carried her high up into
the air.</p>

<p>The frightened waiting-women ran to report to the
king what had happened to the princess; whereupon
the king immediately let loose all his greyhounds to
seize the cat which had been the cause of his daughter
being carried off a second time. The dogs followed
the cat closely, and were on the point of catching her,
when she, just in the nick of time, saw a cave, with a
very narrow entrance, and ran into it for shelter. There
the dogs tried to follow her, or to widen the mouth of
the cave with their claws, but all in vain; so, after
barking a long time very furiously, they at length grew
weary, and stole back ashamed and afraid to the king&rsquo;s
stables.</p>

<p>When all the greyhounds were out of sight the cat
changed herself back into a fox, and ran off in a straight
line towards the castle, where she found her young
master very joyful, for the kumrekusha had already
brought back to him his beautiful wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>291]</a></span>
Now the king was exceedingly angry to think that he
had again lost his daughter, and he was all the more
angry to think that such poor creatures as a bird and a
cat had succeeded in carrying her off after all his precautions.
So, in his great wrath, he resolved to make
a general war on the animals, and entirely exterminate
them.</p>

<p>To this end he gathered together a very large army,
and determined to be himself their leader. The news
of the king&rsquo;s intention spread swiftly over the whole
kingdom, whereupon the fox called, for the third time,
all her friends&mdash;the bear, the wolf, the kumrekusha, the
mouse, the mole, and the hare&mdash;together, to a general
council.</p>

<p>When all were assembled the fox addressed them
thus: &lsquo;My friends, the king has declared war against
us, and intends to destroy us all. Now it is our duty
to defend ourselves in the best way we can. Let us
each see what number of animals we are able to muster.
How many of your brother bears do you think <em>you</em> can
bring to our help, my good Bruin?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The bear got up as quickly as he could on his hind
legs, and brummed out, &lsquo;I am sure I can bring a
hundred.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And how many of your friends can <em>you</em> bring, my
good wolf?&rsquo; asked the fox anxiously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can bring at least five hundred wolves with me,&rsquo;
said the wolf with an air of importance.</p>

<p>The fox nodded her satisfaction and continued, &lsquo;And
what can <em>you</em> do for us, dear master hare?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>292]</a></span>
&lsquo;Well, I think I can bring about eight hundred,&rsquo;
said the hare cautiously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what can <em>you</em> do, you dear little mouse?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, <em>I</em> can certainly bring three thousand mice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, indeed!&mdash;and you, Mr. Mole?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sure I can gather eight thousand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And now what number do you think you can bring
us, my great friend, kumrekusha?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I fear not more than two or three hundred, at the
very best,&rsquo; said the kumrekusha sadly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very good; now all of you go at once and collect
your friends; when you have brought all you can, we
will decide what is to be done,&rsquo; said the fox; whereupon
the council broke up, and the animals dispersed in
different directions throughout the forest.</p>

<p>Not very long after, very unusual noises were heard in
the neighbourhood of the castle. There was a great
shaking of trees; and the growling of bears and the
short sharp barking of wolves broke the usual quiet of
the forest. The army of animals was gathering from all
sides at the appointed place.</p>

<p>When all were gathered together the fox explained to
them her plans in these words:&mdash;&lsquo;When the king&rsquo;s
army stops on its march to rest the first night, then you,
bears and wolves, must be prepared to attack and kill
all the horses. If, notwithstanding this, the army
proceeds further, you mice must be ready to bite and
destroy all the saddle-straps and belts while the soldiers
are resting the second night, and you hares must gnaw
through the ropes with which the men draw the cannon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>293]</a></span>
If the king still persists in his march, you moles must
go the third night and dig out the earth under the road
they will take the next day, and must make a ditch full
fifteen yards in breadth and twenty yards in depth all
round their camp. Next morning, when the army
begins to march over this ground which has been
hollowed out, you kumrekushas must throw down on
them from above heavy stones while the earth will give
way under them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The plan was approved, and all the animals went off
briskly to attend to their allotted duties.</p>

<p>When the king&rsquo;s army awoke, after their first night&rsquo;s
rest on their march, they beheld, to their great consternation,
that all the horses were killed. This sad news
was reported at once to the king; but he only sent
back for more horses, and, when they came late in the
day, pursued his march.</p>

<p>The second night the mice crept quietly into the camp,
and nibbled diligently at the horses&rsquo; saddles and at the
soldiers&rsquo; belts, while the hares as busily gnawed at the
ropes with which the men drew the cannon.</p>

<p>Next morning the soldiers were terrified, seeing the
mischief the animals had done. The king, however,
reassured them, and sent back to the city for new saddles
and belts. When they were at length brought he
resolutely pursued his march, only the more determined
to revenge himself on these presumptuous and despised
enemies.</p>

<p>On the third night, while the soldiers were sleeping,
the moles worked incessantly in digging round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>294]</a></span>
camp a wide and deep trench underground. About midnight
the fox sent the bears to help the moles, and to
carry away the loads of earth.</p>

<p>Next morning the king&rsquo;s soldiers were delighted to
find that no harm seemed to have been done on the
previous night to their horses or straps, and started with
new courage on their march. But their march was
quickly arrested, for soon the heavy horsemen and
artillery began to fall through the hollow ground, and
the king, when he observed that, called out, &lsquo;Let us turn
back. I see God himself is against us, since we have
declared war against the animals. I will give up my
daughter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then the army turned back, amidst the rejoicings of
the soldiers. The men found, however, to their great
surprise and fear, that whichever way they turned, they
fell through the earth. To make their consternation yet
more complete, the kumrekushas now began to throw
down heavy stones on them, which crushed them completely.
In this way the king, as well as his whole
army, perished.</p>

<p>Very soon afterwards the young nobleman, who had
married the king&rsquo;s daughter, went to the enemy&rsquo;s capital
and took possession of the king&rsquo;s palace, taking with
him all his animals; and there they all lived long and
happily together.</p>

<h2><a name="chap27" id="chap27"></a>THE LEGEND OF ST. GEORGE.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NCE upon a time all the saints assembled in order to
divide amongst themselves the treasures of the
world. And, in this division, each saint obtained something
which satisfied him.</p>

<p>The beautiful summer, with all its wealth of flowers,
fell to the lot of St. George: to St. Elias fell the clouds
and the thunder; and to St. Pantelija the tempest. St.
Peter obtained the keys of heaven: to St. Nicholas fell
the seas, and the ships upon them; and to the Archangel
Michael fell the right of gathering and guarding the
souls of the dying. St. John was chosen to preside over
friendship and &lsquo;<i>koom-ship</i>,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and to the holy Lady Mary
the saints committed the charge of the lawless country
of the cursed Troyan,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> in order that she might bring it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>296]</a></span>
to a state of peace, and establish therein the true
religion.</p>

In some versions of this poem this &lsquo;Troyan&rsquo; is changed into &lsquo;India.&rsquo;
Probably there is here a reference to the theory that the Turks and
Troyans were the same people. Knolles, in the opening chapter of his
&lsquo;General Historie of the Turkes,&rsquo; says, &lsquo;Some, after the manner of most
nations, derive them from the Troians, led thereunto by the affinity of the
words Turci and Teucri; supposing&mdash;but with what probability I know
not&mdash;the word Turci or Turks to have been made of the corruption of
the word Teucri, the common name of the Trojans; as also for that the
Turks have of long most inhabited the lesser Asia, wherein the antient
and most famous city of Troy sometime stood.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Edit.</i> <a href="#FNanchor_35_35">Back</a></p>
</div>

<p>About a year had passed away since the saints had
thus divided amongst themselves the treasures of the
world, when one day the holy Lady Mary entered the
assembly, evidently greatly afflicted, and with large tears
falling over her white cheeks. She greeted &lsquo;<em>in the
name of God!</em>&rsquo; her brethren the saints, and these gave
her back her greeting. Then St. Elias addressed her,
saying, &lsquo;<em>Our</em> sister, holy Mary, wherefore are you
grieving? Why are you shedding these tears? You
are, perhaps, dissatisfied with the lot which fell to you
when we divided the treasures?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the holy Mary answered, &lsquo;My brethren, ye who
are the righteousness of God, when you divided the
treasures you gave me also a share therein, and therewith
I am satisfied. Yet I have good cause, nevertheless,
to be sorely grieved. I come but now from the
city of the Troyan, and I have been unable to bring it to
peace and the true faith. There the young people do
not reverence their elders&mdash;there the brother challenges
his own brother to mortal combat,&mdash;there the <i>koom</i> is
pursuing his <i>koom</i> in the law courts,&mdash;there the brother
intermarries with his own sister, and the <i>koom</i> with his
<i>kooma</i>,&mdash;there the holy Sabbath is violated, and, worst
of all, there they do not pray to the true God. The
people have made to themselves a god of silver, and to
this idol do they pray. Now, what can I do, my dear
brethren, except to pray that the true God should send
his lightnings from heaven to destroy the fortress and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>297]</a></span>
fortifications, and to burn down the cities and villages?
Then, perhaps, the people of the Troyan country
may come to see the great wickedness and
repent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>St. Elias said to her these words, &lsquo;Our sister, holy
Mary, do not do this thing! Rather let us all pray God
to allow us to give some warning to the people&mdash;that
He orders snow to fall on Mitrovdan, and remain until
St. George&rsquo;s day;<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> and another snow to fall on St.
George&rsquo;s day, and lie on the earth until Mitrovdan;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
so that no seeds can be sown, and no ewes can rear their
lambs. In this way, perhaps, the pride of the earth may
be subdued, and the people brought at last to
repentance.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>All the saints approved the proposal of St. Elias, and
acted as he had said. Then a great snow fell on
Mitrovdan, and remained until St. George&rsquo;s day, and a
second snowfall came on St. George&rsquo;s day, and lay on
the earth until Mitrovdan. No seed could be sown,
therefore, and no lambs could be reared. The people
suffered greatly throughout the year; they would
not, however, repent and mend their ways. Some
of them had part of last year&rsquo;s corn in their garners,
and shiploads of grain were brought from countries
beyond the seas, and so they got somehow through
the year, and went on living just as wickedly as
before.</p>

<p>The holy Mary, seeing this, went a second time to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>298]</a></span>
the assembled saints weeping. After the exchange of
the customary greeting, St. Elias asked her what was the
reason of her tears, and she told him that she was sorely
grieved because the people of the Troyan country, notwithstanding
the chastisement they had suffered, still
continued living in wickedness. Then the saints
resolved to send down a second warning. So they prayed
God to send down the curse of the small-pox. Thereupon
the small-pox appeared amongst the Troyans, and
raged in their country for three full years, carrying off
all the strength and beauty of the people, so that only
the old remained to cough, and the little babes to
cry.</p>

<p>But, when the children grew up, they behaved just as
their parents had done, and neither improved nor
repented. Weeping bitter tears over her white cheeks,
the holy Mary went the third time to the assembly of the
saints, and reported how disorderly and madly the people
of the Troyan land were still living. She said, it was
quite evident that they could not be brought to
repentance, and that, therefore, she intended now to
pray God to send down his lightnings and destroy the
cities and villages.</p>

<p>But St. Elias said again, &lsquo;Not so, my dear sister! not
so! Let us give them yet a third warning.&rsquo; So the
saints prayed to God for the third warning, and God
granted their request.</p>

<p>Next morning, close by the king&rsquo;s palace in the chief
city of the Troyans a green lake appeared, and therein
was an insatiable dragon feeding on young men and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>299]</a></span>
maidens. Every morning, for breakfast, the monster
required a young man who had never been wedded; and
every evening, for supper, he demanded a youthful and
blooming maiden.</p>

<p>This went on for seven years, until, at length, the
turn came to the only daughter of the king. Then the
queen cried loudly and bitterly, and clasped her arms
closely round the neck of her child. Mother and
daughter wept together three days, and when the fourth
day dawned, the queen fell into a light slumber by her
daughter&rsquo;s side. As she slept, she dreamed that a man
appeared to her, and said, &lsquo;O queen of the Troyan city!
do not send your daughter this evening to the lake; but
send her to-morrow, when the day dawns, and the
sun shines. Tell her, when she goes to the lake,
she must bathe her face, and then, turning towards
the east, let her call on the name of the true God.
She must, however, be careful not to mention the
idol of silver. This done, she must wait patiently,
ready to accept whatsoever the true God ordereth for
her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The queen, awakening from her sleep, related at once
her dream to her daughter, and impressed on her the
necessity of carrying out faithfully her instructions.
Weeping bitterly, the king&rsquo;s daughter took leave of her
mother at daybreak, begging the queen to forgive her
the milk with which she had been nourished in her babyhood.
Then she went down to the lake shore, bathed
her face, and, turning eastwards, prayed to the true
God. This done, according to her mother&rsquo;s instructions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>300]</a></span>
she sat down and awaited whatever might happen
to her.</p>

<p>Suddenly there appeared a strange knight mounted
on a magnificent charger. He greeted the maiden &lsquo;in
the name of God!&rsquo; and she, springing up quickly,
returned the greeting courteously. Then the strange
knight, seeing she had been weeping, asked what it was
that troubled her, and wherefore she sat waiting there
alone. In answer to these questions the maiden related
the whole sad story of the dragon, and the fearful fate
which seemed to await her.</p>

<p>When she had finished her narration, the knight
dismounted, and, removing his kalpak from his head,
said, &lsquo;Now I desire to sleep a little, and I wish you
to pass your hand through my hair that I may sleep
more pleasantly.&rsquo; The girl tried to dissuade him from
this, lest the dragon should come whilst he slept, and
devour him also. She said it would be a pity for him
to perish thus needlessly. However, she could not prevail
on him to abandon his purpose, and he fell at once
into a gentle slumber, and slept as quietly as a young
lamb.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, the waters of the lake were
agitated, and the terrible dragon appeared coming
towards them. Then the unknown knight sprang up
quickly into his saddle, and, stretching out his arms,
lifted the maiden up and placed her behind him on
his charger. This done, with one stroke of his lance,
he pinned the dragon down to the bottom of the
lake, where it remained bleeding, but not dead.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>301]</a></span>
Then the knight took the girl back to the palace
of the king, her father, and the queen, who had been
watching anxiously everything that passed, met him
at the gate and delivered up to him the keys of
the city.</p>

<p>The knight, who was no other than St. George, now
walked through the streets of the Troyan city, and,
having gathered the people around him, spoke to them
thus, &lsquo;Listen to me, my children! Pray no more to
the idol of silver, pray only to the one true God! And
you, young people, reverence your elders. All of you
remember that near relatives cannot be permitted to
intermarry. Keep holy the Sabbath, as well as all the
other holy days and saint days.&rsquo; Having thus admonished
them, the holy knight ordered that the temple should be
opened, and when his commands had been obeyed, he
took out of it the silver idol, and melted it into a variety
of ornaments. In the place of the silver idol he placed a
holy picture, and then consecrated the temple, and it
became a church. When this was done, he turned again
to the people, and said, &lsquo;If you will promise to do as I
have told you, I will kill the dragon in the lake;
but if you refuse to do what I have asked of you
I will let him loose again, and I think he will soon make
an end of you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then all the people bowed themselves to the earth
before the holy knight, and shouted aloud, &lsquo;O good and
unknown knight! our brother in God! Deliver us from
the dragon in the lake, and we will do and live just as
you have counselled us!&rsquo; Whereupon they received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>302]</a></span>
the true faith. When they had so done, St. George
returned to the lake, and made the sign of the cross
over it with a stick, and at that very moment both
the lake and dragon disappeared as if they had never
been.</p>

<p>Having done all this, St. George went back to the
heavenly kingdom to recount to the saints there assembled
the conversion of the Troyan people.</p>
